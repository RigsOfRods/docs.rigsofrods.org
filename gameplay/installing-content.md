## Downloading

Visit the [Repository](https://forum.rigsofrods.org/resources/).

![repository](/images/repository.png)

Find something you like. For example, how about the nice [1996 Dodge Viper GTS Coupe](https://forum.rigsofrods.org/resources/1996-dodge-viper-gts-coupe.88/):

![repository-mod](/images/repository-mod.png)

Click the *Download* button at the top right of the page:

![repository-dl](/images/repository-download.png)

## Installing

Once the mod is downloaded, simply place the `*.zip` file into `Documents\My Games\Rigs of Rods\mods` or `~/.rigsofrods/mods` on Linux:

![repository-install](/images/repository-installing-mod.png) 

**NEVER extract the zip file unless specifically mentioned in the file description! I cannot stress this enough.**

You can organize your mods with subfolders. (e.g. `mods\vehicles\DodgeViperGTS.zip`)

That's it! You can launch Rigs of Rods now and your shiny new mod should be ready to use.

# Installing packs 

To install packs (a zip file containing multiple zips inside) such as the [Gabester Vehicle Pack](http://forum.rigsofrods.org/resources/gabester-vehicle-pack.12/) or the [content packs](http://archives.rigsofrods.net/contentpacks/), just extract the zip into the `mods` folder.

# Installing skinzips

Some mods may provide a `*.skinzip` which contains some extra liveries/skins for the vehicle. To install these, just place them inside the `mods` folder.

For more information about skinzips, see [this page](/vehicle-creation/alternate-skins/).

# PSD/PDN files

These are files meant to be used by photo editing programs such as Photoshop or paint.net, they are not meant to be placed in the RoR directories.
