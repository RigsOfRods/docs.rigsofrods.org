# Multiplayer

To play multiplayer, see [this section](/gameplay/beginners-guide/#multiplayer) of the Beginner's Guide.

**Please know that multiplayer is still a work-in-progress, and crashes may happen.**

### Wrong server version

This means you're trying to join a server that is running an earlier/later RoRNet version than what your current RoR version supports.

The latest version, 2020.01, supports RoRNet 2.42.


# Errors

### MSVCP DLLs missing

When launching RoR, you may receive a MSVCP140.dll/MSVCP110.dll/MSVCP100.dll error.

This is caused by the required Visual C++ x86/x64 Redistributable not being installed. 

Install the correct version that matches the `.dll` name in the error then restart your PC.

When the site asks what version to download, just install both. 

- [MSVCP140.dll](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145)

- [MSVCP110.dll](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30679)

- [MSVCP100.dll](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=26999)


### Cannot open Xbox 360 input map 
### Failed to generate list of installed content

When you launch RoR, you may receive the following errors:

![error](/images/error-special-chars.png)

![error2](/images/error-generatecontent.png)

This is caused by having special characters in your Windows username (e.g. `Us√©r`).  

Current workaround:

1. Inside the installation directory, where RoR.exe is (usually `C:\Program Files\Rigs of Rods`) create a folder called `config`
2. Right click `RoR.exe` and click `Properties`
3. Under the `Compatibility` tab, check the `Run this program as administrator` box, then click `Apply` and close the window. 

RoR will now use the `config` folder instead of the default `Documents\Rigs of Rods 0.4` folder. 

If you installed the content packs, you will have to move the `*.zip` files from `Documents\Rigs of Rods 0.4\mods` to `config\mods`. New mods are also installed there.
