# First Run

You are now ready to launch RoR! You spawn as a country person (grey if using 0.34 or lower) known lovingly as RoRbot. You control him with the arrow keys while using `SHIFT` to run and `SPACE` to jump (good for getting over bumps, or if you get stuck).

For the sake of this tutorial, select *North St. Helens*. You spawn you in front of a building known as the *Rig-a-Deal*. This is where you will spawn new trucks. Walk into the "Office" to bring up the selection menu. If your game seems to freeze, don't panic! The truck list can be intensive to load and may take a few seconds. Use the arrow keys to move through the menus. Go to `Transport Trucks` and select the *DAF Semi truck*. The truck spawns inside the Rig-a-Deal with you inside it. If you happen to spawn the truck with RoRbot outside of the vehicle, simply hit `ENTER`/`RETURN` to get in a vehicle.

# Driving

The DAF semi isn't the fastest or most agile truck in the game, but it serves us a purpose later. The camera inside the Rig-a-deal is fixed, so you will be unable to move it until you leave. Switch to the in-cab camera by hitting `C` twice. Use the `UP` arrow key to accelerate out of the *Rig-a-Deal* (Rigs of Rods uses a simulated clutch which begins to engages at a specific point. This why the semi doesn't move until 1000 RPM). Use `DOWN` to brake, and `LEFT`/`RIGHT` arrows to steer. Use `PGUP`/`PGDOWN` to select your transmission direction/speed.

Start by exploring Coldwater, the town you begin in. It isn't very big but provides some decent moving room. If you get stuck, or wreck, hit `I` to reset back to the *Rig-a-Deal*, `BACKSPACE` to reset the truck in its current position, or you may also use *Rod's Truck service* to repair your truck.

You can switch transmission modes by hitting `Q`. There are 5 transmission modes are available: 
* AUTOMATIC
  * The gear change is fully automatic, player does not have to take care about. 
* SEMIAUTO
  * The gear is changed on user request. No clutch should be pressed to change gear, vehicle takes care of that. Just use `A` and `Z` to shift. 
* MANUAL (also named as SEQUENTIAL)
  * The user must press clutch and select whether it is needed to switch up or down. Depress the clutch by hitting `LEFT SHIFT`, then press `A` to upshift or `Z` to downshift. 
* MANUAL_STICK
 * This mode is useful if you have a game controller with H-shift (like Logitech G25). In this mode the player can set gears 1-6, N, and R directly by the stick. 
* MANUAL_RANGE
 * This mode is mostly used in vehicles having more gears than 6. In this case you can select from 3 ranges: low (gear 1-6), medium (gear 7-12), high (gear 13-18) by pressing the appropriate button. Like if you want to select the 8th gear, you have to select gear N first, press the midrange button, then select the 2nd gear on the h-stick. Remember, range selection can be made only if the gear is in N.

If you stall, there are 2 keys to be remembered: `X` enables or disables the electricity in the vehicle, and `S` activates the starter. If you see a yellow battery sign lit on the screen, you could use this button to crank up the engine.

Remember how to change the camera? Hit `C` again. You're now in third-person view and can move the camera around. Use the number pad (specifically `2`, `4`, `6`, and `8`) to move the camera. Pressing `5` resets the camera. `9` and `3` zoom in/out respectively and `1` gives you a front view of your truck.

Now, make your way back to the *Rig-a-Deal*.

# Trailer Loads

You should see a large, grey, open-platform with an orange console. Park the truck (use `P` to set the parking brake) and hit `ENTER`/`RETURN` to get out. Note that the same camera commands work with RoRbot. Step in front of the orange console.

Select the *37 ton semi trailer*. Get back in the semi and drive in front of the load. Use the camera in third-person view to help you if you need. Back into the trailer. When you get close, use `F1`/`F2` to lower and raise the trailer legs respectively. The hook points must be within 10cm to hook, so it may take some practice to get close. When you think you're close, hit `L`. If you're close enough, the semi will latch to the trailer. Raise the legs by holding `F1`. You can now drive around with the trailer. You will notice that the trailer has a large effect on how the semi pulls and handles! This process is the same for most any loads. In some cases you can secure loads to trucks using `O`. NOTE: on some computers trailers may increase lag or decrease FPS(frames per second) dramatically!

# Flying

Now that we've become comfortable with driving. Let's try to fly. Walk or drive to the plane which is sitting on the runway. This is the *Antonov 12*. Get into it and apply the parking brake by pressing `P`. Turn on the flying lights by pressing `M`. Start the engines by using your mouse to click the "ON" buttons in the lower right hand corner (or by pressing `CTRL+HOME`). When the engines settle to the appropriate idle speed (somewhere near 750rpm), release the parking brake and throttle the engines to full. If you have a short runway, be sure to use the flaps with 1/2 (this is especially helpful in multiplayer). When you reach 75-80 knots, lift up by pressing the `DOWN` arrow. Steer with the `LEFT`/`RIGHT` arrows and control the rudder with `Z` and `X`. Raise the landing gear, in this plane, by holding `F3`. The An-12 does not stand high speeds (175+ knots) well, and you may find that if you go too fast the wings will break apart!

When it comes to landing, make sure you have room to slow down and take your time. Going straight into the runway is the easiest way to land when you first start off. It may take a few passes to go head-on so don't be afraid to abort a landing and throttle back up to regain altitude. The entire process is easier if you shadows enabled, but is possible without. When you land, hit `R` to reverse thrust and throttle up to slow down in addition to using `B` to brake the wheels.

This tutorial does not make use of the autopilot. For more information regarding the use of autopilot, see [How to use the autopilot](https://xror.avrintech.net/rorwikibackup/index.php/How_to_use_the_autopilot).

# Boating

We must explore beyond Coldwater to get to the marina. Take the main road out of Coldwater, heading southwest toward the Elk Hotel. Take the second left after you leave town. You should see the water soon. When you arrive at the marina, you should see marina-style boat docks and a ramp along with a building. Walk around to the front of the building and enter the open door. Choose the Wahoo boat. Boats are are still a bit primitive at this stage. Hence they are relatively easy to drive. Use `PGUP`/`PGDOWN` to throttle and `LEFT`/`RIGHT` to steer. Use `UP` to center the throttle (to neutral) and `DOWN` to center the rudder. It may take you awhile to get your sea legs. If you have waves enabled, see how far out you can go before you flip over waves!

If your boat is unresponsive to throttle commands, remap your boat keys in the [configurator](http://docs.rigsofrods.org/gameplay/configurator).

# Conclusion

Now that you have a basic grasp of the basic vehicles in RoR, it is now up to you to create your own scenarios. If you feel bored, try your hand at creating your own vehicles, starting with the [Tutorials](https://xror.avrintech.net/rorwikibackup/index.php/Tutorials), or add files from the [repository backup](https://repofiles.avrintech.net/).

# Multiplayer

If you feel like sharing the experience, you can play on one of the many public multiplayer servers. Note that multiplayer is the newest feature to RoR and is still in development and can be unstable at times! Please be patient and if you encounter errors, be sure to read the [Troubleshooting](https://xror.avrintech.net/rorwikibackup/index.php/Troubleshooting) page.

# Changing The Sky Type

Here are 4 easy steps to guide you changing the sky type.

1. Go into the configurator
2. Once inside, go down until you're in the Sky Type section
3. Change `Sandstorm (fastest)` to Caelum `(best looking,slower)` by simply clicking in the drop down box.
4. Start RoR and to speed up the time press the addition/plus key `+` in the number pad section of your keyboard.
5. To reverse the time press the minus key `-` which is also in the number pad section of your keyboard.
6. If you would like to advance time at an even faster rate, press the shift key and use either the `+` or `-` keys.

If done so correctly you will see instant results. Here are some great examples: Example 1 and example 2.
