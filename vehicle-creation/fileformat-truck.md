"Truck" is a text-based file format which defines all physically simulated objects in the game, be it vehicles of any kind, machinery, loads or any other things. The name is historical - Rigs of Rods was originally a heavy truck simulator, other kinds of vehicles came later.

Recognized filename extensions for this format are: `.truck`, `.car`, `.boat`, `.airplane`, `.train`, `.machine`, `.trailer`, `.load`, `.fixed`. Note the extension is only informative, the actual type of object is determined by file contents.

The truckfile is divided into sections, each with defined purpose. Except the title, every section starts with a keyword. Order of sections matters (for example: cinecams requires beams).

Comment lines can be inserted by putting `;` or `//` at the beginning of the line.

# Building Philosophy

See [Vehicle Concepts](/vehicle-creation/vehicle-concepts) to understand the building philosophy. I recommend using the following method for construction:

-   Draw the blueprint of your truck on a piece drawing paper; mark the nodes, and write their number (starting with zero).
-   Edit your truck file; put the title, globals, engine, cameras, nodes, and beams sections in.
-   Run the game to see how it goes. If you forget some beams the truck will fold on itself!
-   When the chassis seems to work well; add wheels, suspension, hydros, etc; And then test drive.
-   When the truck is all working; do the bodywork and texture, and mark most beams as invisible (displaying too many beams has a large performance impact)

To see a simple truck file example, see the [Step by Step Truck Construction](/vehicle-creation/making-softbodies).

# Is It a Truck, Plane, Train or Boat?

Before we start, let's ask an important question: **Is it a truck, plane, train, or boat?** Or what makes a truck a truck and a plane a plane and a train a train, or a boat a boat? Simple:

-   A truck is a description file containing an **engine** section
-   A plane is a description file containing a **turboprops**, **turbojets**, or **pistonprops** section
-   A boat is a description file containing a **screwprops** section
-   A train is a vehicle that drives on a rail (see [Building rail vehicles](/vehicle-creation/rail-vehicles))

Also, notice that:

-   You should not combine more than one propulsion (eg have both an **engine** and a **turboprops** section in the same file)
-   If you have no propulsion, then you are making a load, and the file extension should be `.load`
-   You can have a **wings** section on a truck or a boat (e.g. to add aerodynamic spoilers for stability).
-   You should have a **fusedrag** section on a plane to have a better aerodynamic modeling.
-   A boat needs to have a hull which is defined in the **submesh** section.

# Light Cars

Here a few recommendations for those who want to build a **light car**: RoR is optimized for heavy trucks, so you have to use some extra sections that help you create a realistic car:

-   Use **engoptions** to reduce the engine inertia and set the engine type to **c**
-   Use **brakes** to reduce braking force
-   Use and abuse **set\_beam\_defaults** to soften the car body, or it will be too strong and springy, i.e. almost indestructible.
-   Experiment with the **engine** section to use higher RPM and correct gear ratios.
-   Lighten the **wheels** as much as possible. This is not very easy as they become unstable. Reducing the spring and damping of the wheels helps a lot. Suggested values for 100kg wheels: spring `150000` and damping `1000`.
-   Use the **dashboard-small.mesh prop** as a dashboard. (unless you have a custom dashboard you want to use.)

# Documentation style guide

Every keyword (directive, inline-section or section) which has parameters should have them listed in this manner:

-   **Required parameter**:
    <span style="color:#BD0058">Data type</span>;
    <span style="color:#0B8A00">default = `VALUE`</span>; Explanatory text.
-   **Example required parameter**:
    <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>;
    <span style="color:#0B8A00">default = `-1.0`</span>; Parameters are written as shown, followed by a colon. 
    The data type should be easy to understand for a human, not technically accurate.
-   **Another required parameter**:
    <span style="color:#BD0058">Positive decimal</span>;
    The "default" text can be omitted if the parameter has no default.
    The "data type" field should always be followed by semicolon.
-   **Optional parameter**
    <span style="color:#666">(optional)</span>: <span style="color:#BD0058">Data type</span>;
    <span style="color:#0B8A00">default = `VALUE`</span>;
    Optional parameters have "(optional)" text after them.
-   **Required nullable parameter**
    <span style="color:#666">(nullable)</span>: <span style="color:#BD0058">Data type</span>; 
    <span style="color: #008079">Empty value = `-1`</span>;
    Parameters which must be entered but can contain "empty value" are described (nullable) and have "Empty value" section.
-   **New parameter** 
    <span style="color:#666">(optional)</span>: <span style="background-color:#fb7">\[ Version 0.4+ \]</span>
    <span style="color:#BD0058">Data type</span>; Parameters with version requirements have a <span style="background-color:#fb7">\[ Version \]</span> box.
-   **Options**
    <span style="color:#666">(optional)</span>: <span style="color:#BD0058">String</span>,
    <span style="color:#0B8A00">default = none</span> Options are enumerated as sub-list.
    -   `a`: What this option does.
    -   `b`: Another option
    -   `c` or `C`: Case insensitive option.

# Required Sections

The game will not run without these sections. Every one of these sections must be present for a vehicle to work in the game!

## Title

This is the only section not introduced by a keyword. It is the name of the truck, and it absolutely positively must be the first line of the file.

```
My nice truck
```

## Globals

This section defines some global parameters. Those parameters are:

-   **dry mass** - <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>;
    The weight RoR will try to give the truck (affected by minimum node weight, see below).
    Weight is measured in kilograms. (For you people in non-metric countries, a kilogram is 2.2 pounds.)
-   **Load mass -** <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>;
    Total mass of all nodes marked with the option "l".
-   **Material name** - <span style="color:#BD0058">String</span>;
    The name of the material that will be used to texture the truck's submesh.
    This material must be defined in a separate material file.


```
globals
;dry mass, cargo mass, material
10000.0,  1000.0,     tracks/semi
```

## Nodes

This section begins the structural definition of the vehicle. Each line defines a node.

-   **Node number**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Positive decimal number</span>; The first parameter is the node number. These numbers must be consecutive.
    <u>Important:</u> Do <u>NOT</u> use node 0 for any moving stuff like propellers, commands etc. It's the reference for some calculations in RoR and should be part of the rigid frame of your truck.
-   **X position (in meters)**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>; Node's X coordinate.
-   **Y position (in meters)**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>; Node's Y coordinate.
-   **Z position (in meters)**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>; Node's Z coordinate.
-   **Options** <span style="color:#666">(optional)</span>: <span style="color:#BD0058">String</span>; <span style="color:#0B8A00">default = none</span>; Node options. You can combine multiple flags.
    -   **n**: This node can be grabbed with the mouse. (Standard node)
    -   **m** <span style="background-color:#fb7">\[ Version 0.39.07+ \]</span>: This node can't be grabbed with the mouse. (Useful for switching levers with the mouse.)
    -   **f**: This node will not produce sparks. (Useful for support feet or hand made wheels.)
    -   **x**: This node is the exhaust point. (requires a "y" node) (see the [exhausts](#exhausts) section)
    -   **y**: The exhaust reference point. This node should be placed opposite of the direction that you want the exhaust to come from.
    -   **c**: This node will not detect contact with ground. (Can be used for optimization on inner chassis parts, for instance.)
    -   **h**: This node is a hook point. (Like the hook on a crane, or a winch, or whatever.) RoR will create a [beam](#beams) between this Node and Node\#0. If this is Node\#0, it will link it to Node\#1 (even if it isn't defined yet).
    -   **e**: This node is a terrain editing point (Like in the terrain editor truck. Not used as of version 0.4.0+)
    -   **b**: This node is assigned an extra buoyancy force (Experimental!)
    -   **p** <span style="background-color:#fb7">\[ Version 0.36.3+ \]</span>: Disables particle effects for this node (Like dust.)
    -   **L** <span style="background-color:#fb7">\[ Version 0.36.3+ \]</span>: Enables node settings logging into the ror.log for this node
    -   **l**: This node bears a part of the cargo load
-   **Load mass (in Kilograms)** <span style="color:#666">(optional, needs **l** flag)</span>: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>; Overrides the load mass for this node. Only valid if used with **l** option.
     Please note that the load-nodes where you specify the mass explicitly are not calculated with the global load mass. So if you specify a custom mass on any load, you will also increase the mass on all other nodes if you do not decrease the global mass.

NOTE: You can put a comment at the end of a node-line.

```
nodes
;id,    x,    y,    z,     options
;main chassis
0, 0.00, 0.75, 0.66
1, 0.00, 0.75, 1.84
2, 0.63, 0.75, 0.66
3, 0.63, 0.36, 0.66, l
4, 0.63, 0.75, 1.84
5, 0.63, 0.36, 1.84, n
6, 1.48, 0.75, 0.66, l
7, 1.48, 0.00, 0.66
8, 1.48, 0.75, 1.84, c
9, 1.48, 0.00, 1.84, x
10, 2.33, 0.75, 0.66, y
11, 2.33, 0.00, 0.66
```

This section supports multiple options as argument.

If you want a `f` and `b` node together you could write something like this:

```
nodes
11, 2.33, 0.00, 0.66, fb
```

This setting will set the node mass to 2000 kilograms:

```
nodes
14, 1.36, 0.00, 1.97, l 2000
```


This setting will set the node as non-contactable and set the mass to 2000 kilograms:

```
nodes
14, 1.36, 0.00, 1.97, cl 2000
```

You can debug your truck's node masses by enabling `Debug Truck Mass` in RoRConfig:

![rorconfig-truckmassdebug](/images/rorconfig-truckmassdebug.png)

Look into your `RoR.log` after loading and you could see something like this:

```
Node 0 : 3662 kg
Node 1 : 1730 kg
...
Node 13 : 1180 kg (normal load node: 6000 kg / 6 nodes)
Node 14 : 1180 kg (normal load node: 6000 kg / 6 nodes)
...
Node 136 : 5026 kg (overridden by node mass)
Node 141 mass (20kg) too light. Resetting to minimass (50kg).
...
TOTAL VEHICLE MASS: 32399 kg
```

You can set any option property, loadweight, friction, volume, and surface-coefficients as default with [set\_node\_defaults](#set_node_defaults).

## Nodes2

Nodes2 use the same syntax as nodes, except the first argument can be any string instead of a number. After using a name for a node in the nodes2 section, you can use it for any node parsing throughout the rest of the file. valid characters for the string: a-z,A-Z,0-9, \_

For example:

```
nodes2
name,    x,    y,    z,     options
main chassis
0, 0.00, 0.75, 0.66
1, 0.00, 0.75, 1.84
special_node, 0.63, 0.75, 0.66
3, 0.63, 0.36, 0.66,l
4, 0.63, 0.75, 1.84
another_one, 0.63, 0.36, 1.84
hook_node, 1.48, 0.75, 0.66,lh 50
```


We advise to use the following scheme for naming the nodes:

```
function_section_name
```

So for example a rear hook node could look like this:

```
hook_rear_hook1
```

There is also a fallback in place which will resolve named nodes to normal node numbers. For example if you convert an existing truck to named nodes (nodes2) and don't want to replace all occurrences, just leave the numbers there, it will take them up as classic node numbers.

Things to keep in mind:

-   Transition from `nodes` to `nodes2` is easy: just replace `nodes` with `nodes2`, the numbers will act as the name strings
-   Transition from `nodes2` to `nodes` is impossible, since nodes rely on the linear numbering of nodes
-   Only use node names without any special characters or spaces (only a-z, A-Z, 0-9, \_, -)
-   You don't need to convert all nodes to nodes2 with names, if a nodes2 named node is not found, it will fallback to using the number as classic node.

## Beams

This section defines all the beams connecting nodes. Each line describes a beam.

-   **node\_A**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Node ID</span>; Connected node
-   **node\_B**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Node ID</span>; Connected node
-   **options** <span style="color:#666">(optional)</span>: <span style="color:#BD0058">String</span>; <span style="color:#0B8A00">default = empty</span>
    -   **v**: Dummy option, does nothing. Beams are visible by default.
    -   **i** : This beam is invisible.
    -   **r** : This beam is a rope (no resistance to compression, but will deform/break when expanded)
    -   **s** : This beam is a support beam (no resistance to expansion, but will deform/break when compressed). Support beams have 1/10th of the damping of the last set\_beam\_defaults setting
-   **extension\_break\_limit** <span style="color:#666">(optional)</span>: <span style="color:#BD0058">Positive real number</span>; <span style="color:#0B8A00">default = 4 \* original length</span>; Only valid with option "**s**"

TIP: Support beams are very useful for limiting movement of body panels like trunks, hoods, and doors from going inside the car while still allowing rotation without costly and complicated collisions. Default expansion break length is . User set break length factor is optional. Valid factors are &gt; 0.0. .

```
beams
;node1, node2, options
0,     1
2,     4
3,     5,        i
6,     8,        i
7,     9
10,    12,       i
11,    13,       i
; support beam, default extension break limit
11,    23,       s
; visible support beam, user set extension break limit original spawn length * 12.5
11,    24,       s 12.5
```

This section supports multiple options as argument. If you want a 'i' and 'r' node together you could write something like this:

```
;invisible rope
11,    13,       ir
; invisible support beam, default extension break limit
11,    25,       is
; invisible support beam, user set extension break limit original spawn length * 25
11,    26,       si 25.0
```

## Cameras

This section is important. It helps to position the truck in space, by defining a local direction reference. This is used to measure the pitch and the roll of the truck. It is also very important to orient the truck's cameras. 

The three parameters are node numbers. The first is the reference node and may be anywhere. The second must be behind the first (if you look at the front of the truck, it is hidden behind the first). The third must be at the left of the first (if you look to the right of the truck, it is hidden by the first). 

Correct relative placement of these nodes is important, or it may break the inside camera view.

![Cameras](/images/truckfile-cameras.gif)

```
cameras
;center, back, left
0, 2, 1
```

## Cinecam

This defines the position of the in-truck camera. It is a special node suspended from eight chassis nodes.

Required parameters:

-   **X,Y,Z position (in meters)**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real numbers</span>; Coordinates of the camera point.
-   **8 node bindings**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Node ID</span>; Nodes to which the camera point is bound.

Optional parameters:

-   **beam spring**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>; Default=8000
-   **beam damping**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>; Default=800
-   **node weight (Kg)**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>; <span style="background-color:#fb7">\[ Upcoming versions 0.4.8+ \]</span> Weight of the camera point. Default=20Kg

Example:

```
cinecam
;  x,   y,   z, <---------8 bindings--------->, Opt: spring, damping, node-weight
0.66, 2.0, 1.8, 75, 76, 77, 78, 73, 74, 53, 54,      8000.0,   800.0,        20.0
```

## End

This section will stop the parser. Everything after it will be ignored.

Since version 0.4.5, it's optional. In previous versions it's STRICTLY REQUIRED - without it, the vehicle will crash the game.

```
end
```

# Organizational Sections

These sections are not required, but will make it easier to locate your file or work with. Do not use carets in your syntax, they are used to mark sections!

## GUID

You should use the guid feature to allow RoR to recognize your truck uniquely. 

This section is required for [skins](/vehicle-creation/alternate-skins).

```
;guid <GUID>
guid 6daaee29-e462-4d99-96d2-4577294f7b10
```

You can generate some GUIDs [here](https://www.guidgenerator.com).

## Fileformatversion

This tells RoR what version of RoR your truck is built for. Most trucks built today should use `fileformatversion 3`

-   Version 1 = Pre-RoR 0.32
-   Version 2 = RoR 0.32 - 0.35
-   Version 3 = Post-RoR 0.36
-   Leaving out this tag will result in version 1.


```
fileformatversion 3
```

## Author

```
author <Type> <AuthorID> <AuthorName> <Email>
```

-   Type = Tells what the author referenced in the next section did. Recommended types to put: chassis, texture, support, etc.

-   AuthorID = ID of the author's RoR Forum account. To get your ID, view your forum profile and check the number shown in the URL. For example: 

<https://forum.rigsofrods.org/members/curiousmike.5831/> 

`5831` would be the ID. 

-   AuthorName = The author's username.

-   Email = The author's e-mail. (optional)

Each author requires a separate line.

```
author chassis 4    heinz_peter               heinz@mail.com
author texture 123  forname_surname_othername someuser@mail.com
author support 5487 otheruser                 otheruser@mail.com
```

Please note: **Do not use spaces** in the type, authorname, or email. Instead, use an underscore ( \_ ). In the game, the underscore will be replaced with a space.

## Description

```
description
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing
elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et
dolore magna aliqua.
end_description
```

Pretty self-explanatory. **Only the first 3 lines** will get displayed in the Truck HUD. **Do not put keywords in the description;** they will mess up the truck file.

## Fileinfo

General info about the vehicle.

-   **Unique ID** <span style="color:#666">(nullable)</span>: <span style="color:#BD0058">String</span>; <span style="color:#0B8A00">default = -1</span>; <span style="color: #008079">Empty value = -1</span>; This field specifies the unique file ID (you get one by uploading it to the repository).

-   **Category ID** <span style="color:#666">(optional)</span> <span style="color:#666">(nullable)</span>: <span style="color:#BD0058">Decimal number</span>; <span style="color:#0B8A00">default = -1</span>; <span style="color: #008079">Empty value = -1</span>; This is the category number from the repository. It is recommended that you give your truck a category.

-   **File version** <span style="color:#666">(optional)</span>: <span style="color:#BD0058">Decimal number</span>; <span style="color:#0B8A00">default = 0</span>; Version of the vehicle, read by users and the repository. For backwards compatibility, this field also accepts real number (a warning is reported).

## Help

**NOTE: This section is not used as of version 0.39.5+**

The help section gives the name of the material used for the help panel on the in-game dashboard. This material must be defined elsewhere in a material file. This is optional. (But it looks cool, so use it!)

NOTE: This setting can be overriden by [section "guisettings"](#guisettings)

```
help
tracks/semihelp
```

## Comments

Comments are ignored by RoR. They are useful for telling users what things do in the truck file. Comments can be put anywhere by putting a semicolon ( `;` ) as the first character of the line to be commented.

You can also comment out several lines of text using this format:

```
comment
One morning, as Gregor Samsa was waking up from anxious dreams,
he discovered that in bed he had been changed into a monstrous vermin.
He lay on his armour-hard back and saw, as he lifted his head up
a little, his brown, arched abdomen divided up into rigid bow-like
sections. From this height the blanket, just about ready to slide off
completely, could hardly stay in place. His numerous legs, pitifully
thin in comparison to the rest of his circumference, flickered helplessly
before his eyes.
end_comment
```

## hideInChooser

Excludes the vehicle/load from being shown in the vehicle menu on top of the screen. Place the single keyword somewhere in the vehicle/load file.

```
hideInChooser
```

# Vehicle-specific

The following sections define important vehicle parts, like wheels, shock absorbers, and the like.

## Engine

The engine section contains the engine parameters. Parameters are:

-   **Shift down RPM**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span> The engine speed at which the automatic transmission will shift down (gear 2 and up) or the clutch engages (driving off).
-   **Shift up RPM**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span> The engine speed at which the automatic transmission will shift up. Actual redline is this value x1.25.
-   **Torque**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span> Engine torque in newton-meters (N/m). The higher the value, the faster a truck will accelerate. RoR uses a flat torque model, usually correct for large intercooled turbo diesels.
-   **Global gear Ratio**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span> A global gear conversion ratio. (Final gear reduction ratio)
-   **Rear gear ratio**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span> Gear ratio of reverse. For every turn of the wheel the engine will have to turn this many times (not counting the differential ratio).
-   **Neutral gear ratio**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span> Gear ratio of neutral gear. 1.0 is a good one as it helps to distinguish between reverse and forward gears
-   **First gear ratio**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span> Gear ratio of 1st gear.
-   **Second/etc gear ratio**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span> Gear ratio of all further gears. Note there must be between 1 and 21 forward gears. The final gear **must be followed by a -1 value** (parser will emit a warning if the terminator is missing).

```
engine
;min rpm, max rpm, torque, differential, reverse, neutral,   1st,  2nd,  3rd,  4th,  5th,  6th...
  1000.0,  1500.0, 8000.0,         2.00,   10.85,   10.00, 13.86, 9.52, 6.56, 5.48, 4.58, 3.83, 3.02, 2.53, 2.08, 1.74, 1.43, 1.20, 1.00, -1.0
```

One good source of practical gear ratios is [Eaton Fuller](http://www.roadranger.com/Roadranger/productssolutions/transmissions/index.htm). To see the ratios, click the name of the transmission and find "Product Specifications Guide". It's wise to make sure you can get into final gear. If your vehicle decelerates in a gear you may not have enough power, or the gear ratio may be too high.

## Engoption

Engoption sets optional parameters to the engine. It is mainly used for car engines. Parameters are:

-   **Engine inertia**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>, <span style="color:#0B8A00">default = 10.0</span>. The default game value is correct for a large diesel engine. For smaller engines you probably want smaller values. 1.0 or 0.5 would be appropriate for small atmospheric engines, for instance.
-   **Engine type**: <span style="color:#BD0058">One Character String</span>, <span style="color:#0B8A00">default = t</span>. Valid types are **t** for truck engine and **c** for car engine. This parameter changes engine sound and other engine characteristics.
-   **Clutch Force** <span style="color:#666">(optional)</span>: <span style="background-color:#fb7">\[ Version 0.36.2+ \]</span> <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>, <span style="color:#0B8A00">default = 10000 for trucks, 5000 for cars</span>.
-   **Shift Time**: <span style="color:#666">(optional)</span>: <span style="background-color:#fb7">\[ Version 0.36.2+ \]</span> <span style="color:#BD0058">Positive real number</span>, <span style="color:#0B8A00">default = 0.2 seconds</span>. Time (in seconds) that it takes to shift. Requires a defined **clutch force** parameter to work.
-   **Clutch Time** <span style="color:#666">(optional)</span>: <span style="background-color:#fb7">\[ Version 0.36.2+ \]</span> <span style="color:#BD0058">Positive real number</span>, <span style="color:#0B8A00">default = 0.5 seconds</span>. Time (in seconds) the clutch takes to apply. Requires a defined **clutch force** parameter to work.
-   **Post Shift Time** <span style="color:#666">(optional)</span>: <span style="background-color:#fb7">\[ Version 0.36.2+ \]</span> <span style="color:#BD0058">Positive real number</span>, <span style="color:#0B8A00">default = 0.2 seconds</span>. Time (in seconds) until full torque is transferred. Requires a defined **clutch force** parameter to work.
-   **Stall RPM** <span style="color:#666">(optional)</span>: <span style="background-color:#fb7">\[ Version 0.4.0.7+ \]</span> <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>, <span style="color:#0B8A00">default = 300</span>. RPM where the engine will stall.
-   **Idle RPM** <span style="color:#666">(optional)</span>: <span style="background-color:#fb7">\[ Version 0.4.0.7+ \]</span> <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>, <span style="color:#0B8A00">default = 800</span>. Idle RPM the engine should attempt to maintain.
-   **Max Idle Mixture** <span style="color:#666">(optional)</span>: <span style="background-color:#fb7">\[ Version 0.4.0.7+ \]</span> <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>, <span style="color:#0B8A00">default = 0.1</span>. Defines the maximum amount of throttle the truck will use to maintain the idle RPM.
-   **Min Idle Mixture** <span style="color:#666">(optional)</span>: <span style="background-color:#fb7">\[ Version 0.4.0.7+ \]</span> <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>, <span style="color:#0B8A00">default = 0.0</span>. Defines the minimum amount of throttle the truck will use to maintain the idle RPM.
-   **Braking torque** <span style="color:#666">(optional)</span>: <span style="background-color:#fb7">\[ Version 0.4.8.0+ \]</span> <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>, <span style="color:#0B8A00">default = engine_torque / 5</span>. Defines the amount of engine braking when you let go of the throttle.

```

PROTIP: Use the "Engine inertia" value to make the engine start faster. With a value of 0.1, the engine will start instantly. With a value of 10, the engine requires about 30 seconds of cranking before it starts. Values between 1 and 3.5 are great for vehicles that you drive frequently, or race vehicles and the like that you want to start fast. However, using a higher value makes it harder to stall the engine. Making something to tow a lot of weight? Raise it up to 9 or 10 and it won't really stall, ever. (With values over 10, it may not start at all, so be careful.)

## Engturbo

Engine's Turbo settings:

When defining this on your truck file, you do not need to put "t" type of vehicle in the engoptions.

There are 2 version of this section:

Using <b>Version 1</b> you have more control over the power added to the engine, but this can end up in unrealistic simulation if the values aren't correctly chosen. Turbo is always giving 20 PSI at max rpm. (Which isn't realistic.) Using <b>Version 2</b> you have less control over the power added, but you can end up with a realistic simulation depending on the maxPSI value.

<b>Version 1: (Not recommended)</b>

-   **type**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Positive real number</span>; Turbo's simulation version, leave it as 1 for this type of simulation.
-   **inertiaFactor**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Positive real number</span>; Turbo's inertia, how much time it will take for the turbo to spool up. Big turbos tend to have Values between 2 and 6, while small turbos are between 0.1 and 1.
-   **numTurbo**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number <0 - 4></span>; The number of turbos in the engine. No effects for the moment.
-   **additionalTorque** <span style="color:#BD0058">Positive real number</span>; Torque in Nm that will be added at max turbo rpm.
-   **engine\_rpm\_op**;<span style="color:#666">(optional)</span>; <span style="color:#BD0058">Positive real number</span>; <span style="color:#0B8A00">default = 0</span>; Engine's RPM at which turbo will start to spool up.

SlopeBrake                10,            5,            12
```

## Wheels

This section is important: it defines the wheels! Parameters are:

-   **Radius** - <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>; The radius of the wheel, in meters.
-   **Width (ignored)** - <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>; Use any number (must be present for compatibility), wheel width is auto-calculated from distance between node1 and node2.
-   **number of rays** - <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>;The number of 'pie pieces' that make up the wheel. For reference, `3` makes the wheel triangular, and `4` makes the wheel square. Recommended values are between `10` and `16`.
-   **Node 1** - <span style="color:#BD0058">Node number or name</span>;The node on the axle where the one side of the wheel starts.
-   **Node 2** - <span style="color:#BD0058">Node number or name</span>;The node on the axle where one side of the wheel ends.
    To clarify, if you imagine a beam that goes right through the middle of the wheel along the axis of rotation, Node 1 and Node 2 would be at the intersection between one side of the wheel and the beam and the intersection between other side of the wheel and the beam.
-   **Rigidity Node** - <span style="color:#BD0058">Node number or name</span>; The number of a special rigidity node (see explanation about [Axle Rigidity](https://archives.rigsofrods.net/wiki/index.php/Axle_Rigidity)). Use `9999` if there is no rigidity node.
-   **Wheel Braking** - <span style="color:#BD0058">Positive real number from range <0 - 4>; </span>`0` for unbraked wheels, `1` for braked wheels. For directional braking, as found in airplanes, use `2` for a left wheel, `3` for a right wheel. In 0.37+, `4` is used for a wheel with a footbrake, but no parking brake.
-   **Wheel Drive** - <span style="color:#BD0058">Positive real number from range <0 - 2>; </span> `0` for undriven wheels, `1` for wheels driven forwards, `2` for wheels driven backwards
-   **Reference arm node** - <span style="color:#BD0058">Node number or name</span>; The [reference arm node](https://archives.rigsofrods.net/wiki/index.php/Arm_node) for the wheel. This is where reaction torque is applied to the chassis. Set it to a node in front of the wheel for more traction and behind the wheel for less traction. Setting the reference arm node to the same node as **Node 1** or **Node 2** gets rid of the effects of the Reference Arm Node.
-   **Mass** - <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>; Mass of the wheel, in kilograms.
-   **Springiness** - <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>; The stiffness of the wheel, somewhat equivalent to tire pressure. Having too much spring will make the steering wheels bounce back and forth during understeer, sending vibrations through the entire vehicle.
-   **Damping** - <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>; The rebound rate of the wheel
-   **Materials** - <span style="color:#BD0058">String</span>; Face material and band material. (no comma between them) If you don't have a custom material, use `tracks/wheelface` for the face and `tracks/wheelband1` for a single wheel or `tracks/wheelband2` for dual mounted wheels.

```

```

Notes:

-   Wheel breaking strength is set by the last Beam defaults in the truck file before the wheels section. This can help the wheel to go faster before it breaks.
-   The order in which the wheels are declared is important: each consecutive pair of wheels is grouped into an axle. A truck cannot have an odd number of powered wheels, since one wheel would not be in a pair. If this happens, the odd wheel will not move.

## Wheels2

This section improves wheels by simulating both wheel tires and rims. The player is able to set tire pressure via key input.

-   **Rim radius** - <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span> The radius of the wheel rim in meters

-   **Number of rays** - <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span> The number of 'pie pieces', or corners, that make up the wheel. For reference, `3` makes the wheel triangular, and `4` makes the wheel square. Recommended values are between `10` and `16`.
-   **Node 1** - <span style="color:#BD0058">Node number/name</span> The node where the wheel starts.
-   **Node 2** - <span style="color:#BD0058">Node number/name</span> The node where the wheel ends. (See [Wheels](#wheels) for an explanation of how this works.)
-   **Rigidity Node** - <span style="color:#BD0058">Node number/name</span> The number of a special rigidity node (see [Axle Rigidity explanation](https://archives.rigsofrods.org/wiki/index.php/Axle_Rigidity)). Use `9999` if there is no rigidity node.
-   **Wheel Braking** - <span style="color:#BD0058">Positive real number from range <0 - 4>; </span> `0` for unbraked wheels, `1` for braked wheels. For directional braking, as found in airplanes, use `2` for a left wheel, `3` for a right wheel. In 0.37+, `4` is used for a wheel with a footbrake, but no parking brake.
-   **Wheel Drive** - <span style="color:#BD0058">Positive real number from range <0 - 2>; </span> `0` for an undriven wheel, `1` for a wheel driven forwards, `2` for a wheel driven backwards.
-   **Reference arm node** - <span style="color:#BD0058">Node number/name</span> The [reference arm node](https://archives.rigsofrods.org/wiki/index.php/Arm_node) for the wheel. This is where reaction torque is applied to the chassis. Set it to a node in front of the wheel for more traction and behind the wheel for less traction.

## Meshwheels

Mesh wheels allows you to do very nice wheels. It takes an Ogre3D mesh of a rim (the rim only, without the tire!). The mesh should be centered, and of the right size for the wheel you want to do: its outer diameter should be the same as the "rim\_radius" parameter, and its width should be the same as the distance between node1 and node2. The other parameters are similar to the [wheels](#wheels) section, though there are a few differences.

The side value should be `l` or `r` depending on the side of the wheel, and the final parameters are the mesh name and the material for the tire. The mapping of the texture should look something like this: ![Meshwheel tire texture](/images/truckfile-meshwheel-tire-texture.jpg)

Here is an example picture of a rim mesh, as it should be modeled. The tire geometry is added dynamically afterward by the game, and will flex like a real tire.

## Meshwheels2

This section works exactly the same way as meshwheels, except one difference.

The tread of the wheel you generate does use the meshwheels section spring and damping ratios while the rim will use the ones from the [set_beam_defaults](#set_beam_defaults).

It enables you to make quite soft and flexing wheels, which have a lot lateral grip and are very reliable and predictable in comparison to normal meshwheels.

Very useful for flex body tires, since the **nodeflip-bug** is mostly gone with this used the right way.

Use [set_beam_defaults](#set_beam_defaults). that make sense for rims (high spring, low damping) while the tires itself can be soft and have high damping values:

```
set_beam_defaults 700000, 350, 60000000, 80000000

```

## Flexbodywheels

This section works exactly the same way then meshwheels2, except 2 differences:

There is a contactive rim generated and you can place a tire mesh which is converted to a flexbody by RoR.

For now, the rim mesh is a prop. Might be upgraded to flexbody later.

This one has complete new tire physics, so for now, happy testing, please give feedback.

    -   `M`: Absolute metric values for shortbound/longbound, settings apply without regarding to the original length of the beam. Use with caution, check `RoR.log` for errors.

**IMPORTANT**:

-   shocks2 needs at least 1500+ as a minimum damping value when using them as inbound/outbound only. (When your shocks2 truck bottoms out at spawn, damping is too low (or the springs don't support the weight of the truck)
-   soft bump shocks need some boundary limit ( 5%+ ) to work proper as soft bump boundaries.
-   You will find any errors in the `RoR.log` regarding to wrong values in 'M' setting or any other shock values.

## Animators

The animator section concerns only Animators referring to game data! They are beams which change their length depending on the variables of the simulation.

The parameters are:

-   **Node 1** - <span style="color:#BD0058">Node name or number</span> The node where the animator starts. Required
-   **Node 2** - <span style="color:#BD0058">Node name or number</span> The node where the animator ends. Required.
-   **lengthening factor** - <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span> A coefficient which specifies how much the animator moves. Required.
-   **Option string** - <span style="color:#BD0058">String</span> Required

Options:

- `vis` - This creates a visible animator. ( It's not necessarily needed, but can help users read the truck file.)
- `inv` - This creates an invisible animator.
- `airspeed` - This animator extends or contracts with the actual speed (not speedometer indicated speed) for any vehicle.
- `vvi` - This animator extends or contracts with the vehicle's vertical velocity.
- `altimeter100k` - This animator extends or contracts with the vehicle's altitude up to 100,000 feet.
- `altimeter10k` - This animator extends or contracts with the vehicle's altitude up to 10,000 feet, at which point it will revert back to its original length.
- `altimeter1k` - This animator extends or contracts with the vehicle's altitude up to 1,000 feet, at which point it will revert back to its original length. These three animators can be used to create altimeters with three needles or similar objects, though for those small applications it is usually recommended that [Add\_animation](#add_animation) be used.
- `aoa` - This animator extends or contracts with the dashboard's angle of attack.
- `flap` - This animator extends or contracts with the flap setting on the vehicle.
- `airbrake` - This animator extends or contracts with the airbrake setting on the vehicle.
- `roll` - This animator extends or contracts with the vehicle's roll. It will flip at 180 degrees roll to -180 degrees roll. This option can be used for an automatic trim feature.
- `pitch` - This animator extends or contracts with the vehicle's pitch. It will flip back at 180 degrees pitch to -180 degrees pitch. This option can be used for an automatic trim feature.
- `throttle1` - This animator extends or contracts with the throttle setting of an aircraft's first engine. This option can be used for thruster mechanics. Valid sources include throttle1, throttle2, etc. etc. up to throttle8.
- `rpm1` - This animator extends or contracts with the RPM of an aircraft's first engine. This option can be used for thruster mechanics. Valid sources include rpm1, rpm2, etc. etc. up to rpm8.
- `aerotorq1` - This animator extends or contracts with the torque of an aircraft's first engine. Note that this only works for propeller engines, because torque is not applicable to jets. Valid sources include aerotorq1, aerotorq2, etc. etc. up to aerotorq8.
- `aeropit1` - This animator extends or contracts with the pitch of an aircraft's first engine. Note that this only makes sense with propeller engines, pitch is not applicable to jets. Valid sources include aeropit1, aeropit2, etc. etc. up to aerotorq8.
- `aerostatus1` - This animator extends with the On/Off/Fire status of an aircraft's first engine. Valid sources include aerostatus1, aerostatus2, etc. etc. up to aerostatus8.
- `brakes` - This animator extends or contracts with the vehicle's brake status.
- `accel` - This animator extends or contracts with the vehicle's accelerator status.
- `clutch` - This animator extends or contracts with the vehicle's clutch status.
- `speedo` - This animator extends or contracts with the speedometer indication. It scales with the guisetting speedometer. (It is best to use it even if there is no custom overlay dashboard; it simplifies the adjustment a lot.)
- `tacho` - This animator extends or contracts with the vehicle's RPM. It scales with guisetting tachometer. (It is best use it even if there is no custom overlay dashboard; simplifies the adjustment a lot.)
- `turbo` - This animator extends or contracts with the vehicle's turbocharger PSI.
- `parking` - This animator extends or contracts with the vehicle's parking brake status.
- `shifterman1` - H-shift left right animator ( ```Reverse | 1-2 | 3-4 | 5-6...11-12``` as positions, scales with engine settings (maxGear)
- `shifterman2` - H-shift forth/back animator ```Reverse-2-6-8-10-12 | 1-3-5-7-9-11``` as positions
- `sequential` - sequential shift animator ( i.e for tiptronic or wheel shift pedals), can be used for commands too ( no settable limits then )
- `shifterlin` - for auto transmission animations or gearselect indicators
- `torque` - animator to simulate engine torque, useful in addition to wheel nodearms
- `difflock` - This animator extends or contracts with the difflock status of the truck (It only works when differentials are present in the truck.)
- `rudderboat` - This animator extends or contracts with the steering hydro on boats.
- `throttleboat` - This animator extends or contracts with the throttle status on boats.
- `shortlimit` - Adds shortbound movement limit to the animator, needs to be followed by a valid number. Limits are calculated in percentage like shocks. <span style="background-color:#fb7">\[ Version 0.38.24+ \]</span>
- `longlimit` - Adds longbound movement limit to the animator, needs to be followed by a valid number. Limits are calculated in percentage like shocks. <span style="background-color:#fb7">\[ Version 0.38.24+ \]</span>

All options need to be connected by an vertical bar `|`, please refer to the example below. 

You can stack multiple options (like: `airpseed | vvi | inv`), but it is not recommended and may result in weird behaviors. 

All animators are scaled to a maximum of -1/+1 as default coefficient, use the ratio setting to get the movement you want. 

Speed or force of the animators is NOT settable, though you can alter movement speed just with simple lever mechanics. 

The longer the lever arm, the slower the node will move. To tune your torque-animator to the needs of the truck, let it just work against a stiff [shocks2](#shocks2). The harder you make the shock, the more engine-rpm torque effect you get. 

Animators can use [set\_inertia\_defaults](#set_inertia_defaults). Inertia helps a lot to smooth instant movement like with shifters or airbrakes.

# Behavior

These sections define behaviors for the vehicle, like command-operated hydraulics and modifications to how beams behave.

## Commands

The commands section describes the "real" hydros, that is, those you command with the function keys. They are like beams, but their length varies depending with the function keys you press. The parameters are:

-   **Node 1**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Node number/name</span>; The node where the command beam starts.
-   **Node 2**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Node number/name</span>; The node where the command beam ends.
-   **Rate of extension/contraction**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span> How fast the command beam moves.
-   **Maximum contraction**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span> The shortest length that the command beam will try to be, as a proportion of its initial length.
-   **Maximum extension**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span> The longest length the command beam will try to be, as a proportion of its initial length.
-   **Contraction key**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Function key code (decimal number)</span> A number representing the function key used to control the command beam. More than one can be controlled with the same key. (See below for the keymap.)
-   **Extension key**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Function key code (decimal number)</span> The key used to extend the command beam.
-   **Option flag** <span style="color:#666">(optional)</span>: <span style="color:#BD0058">Single character</span>
    -   `i`: Makes the command beam invisible.
    -   `r`: Makes the command behave like a rope or a winch (no compression strength).
	- 	`c`: Makes the command beam auto-center: It will automatically return it to its starting position when a lengthening/shortening key is released.
    -   `n`: Placeholder, does nothing (useful as filler when you need to specify description)
-   **Description** <span style="color:#666">(optional)</span>: <span style="color:#BD0058">String</span> A text description that tells the user what the command beam does when the it is activated. This is shown by pressing `CTRL+T` ingame. There is no need to put a key in front of the text (like F1:\_do\_something) this will be done automatically! Writing "hide" will hide the command from the "t-screen".

```
commands
;id1, id2, rate, short, long, keys, keyl, options description
10,  91,  0.1,   1.0,    7,    1,    2,       i Death_machine
12,  93,  0.1,   1.0,    7,    1,    2,       i
14,  90,  0.1,   1.0,    7,    1,    2

126, 132,  0.1,   0.1,  1.0,    5,    6,       r
```

This is the default keymap:

-   1 = `F1`
-   2 = `F2`
-   3 = `F3`

etc. etc.

-   12 = `F12`
-   13 = `CTRL+F1`
-   14 = `CTRL+F2`

etc. etc.

-   24 = `CTRL+F12`
-   25 = `ALT+F1`
-   26 = `ALT+F2`

etc. etc.

-   36 = `ALT+F12`
-   37 = `CTRL+ALT+F1`
-   38 = `CTRL+ALT+F2`

etc. etc.

-   46 = `CTRL+ALT+F10`

**Since RoR 0.4.0.5 it is possible to use up to 84 commands. The keymap changed because of that:**

-   1 = `F1`
-   2 = `F2`
-   3 = `F3`

etc. etc.

-   12 = `F12`
-   13 = `CTRL+F1`
-   14 = `CTRL+F2`

etc. etc.

-   24 = `CTRL+F12`
-   25 = `SHIFT+F1`
-   26 = `SHIFT+F2`

etc. etc.

-   36 = `SHIFT+F12`
-   37 = `ALT+F1`
-   38 = `ALT+F2`

etc. etc.

-   46 = `ALT+F10`
-   49 = `CTRL+SHIFT+F1`
-   50 = `CTRL+SHIFT+F2`

etc. etc.

-   59 = `CTRL+SHIFT+F11`
-   61 = `CTRL+ALT+F1`
-   62 = `CTRL+ALT+F2`

etc. etc.

-   72 = `CTRL+ALT+F12`
-   73 = `CTRL+SHIFT+ALT+F1`
-   74 = `CTRL+SHIFT+ALT+F2`

etc. etc

-   84 = `CTRL+SHIFT+ALT+F12`

Note that some keymapped commands are by default assigned to Windows commands.. i.e. `ALT+F4` closes the active window (in this case the RoR render window). It is best to avoid using those buttons if at all possible.

**If you hold `F4` then hold/press `ALT`, the window should stay open and the command will work.**

## Commands2

Improved commands.

Commands are beams which contract and extend when player presses the corresponding key combination.

Since <span style="background-color:#fb7">\[ Version 0.36.2 \]</span> you can specify an inertia function for your command. This reduces the swing of commands since they will operate smoothly with inertia.

The parameters are:

-   **Node 1**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Node number/name</span>; The node where the command beam starts.
-   **Node 2**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Node number/name</span>; The node where the command beam ends.
-   **Shortening rate**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Positive real number</span>; How fast the command beam shortens.
-   **Lengthening rate**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Positive real number</span>; How fast the command beam lengthens.
-   **Maximum contraction**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Positive real number</span>; The shortest length that the command beam will try to be, as a proportion of its initial length.
-   **Maximum extension**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Positive real number</span>; The longest length the command beam will try to be, as a proportion of its initial length.
-   **Shortening key**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Key code (decimal number)</span>; A number representing the function key needed to compress the command beam. More than one can be controlled with the same key. (see above for keymap)
-   **Lengthening key**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Key code (decimal number)</span>; The key used to extend the command beam.
-   **Option flag(s)** <span style="color:#666">(optional)</span>:
    - `n`: Filler option, does nothing.
    - `i`: Makes the command beam invisible.
    - `r`: Makes the command beam behave like a rope or a winch.
    - `c`: Makes the command beam auto-center: It will automatically return it to its starting position when a lengthening/shortening key is released.
    - `f`: Stops the command moving faster when engine revs increase.
    - `p`: Activates press-once functionality: A single press of a shortening/lengthening key will lengthen/shorten the command beam as much as possible. A second keypress of the key which started the command moving stops the automatic movement.
    - `o`: is like `p`, but it will stop in the center position.
-   **Description** <span style="color:#666">(optional)</span>: <span style="color: #008079">Placeholder = underscore '\_'</span> A text description that tells the user what the command beam does when it is activated. This is shown by pressing `CTRL+T` ingame. There is no need to put a key in front of the text (like F1:\_do\_something) this will be done automatically! Writing "hide" will hide the command from the "t-screen".
-   **Inertia: Start delay factor** <span style="color:#666">(optional)</span>: <span style="background-color:#fb7">\[ Version 0.36.2+ \]</span>; <span style="color:#BD0058">Positive real number</span>; The delay upon command start. Note this isn't time in seconds, but are a factor (the lower the value, the more inertia there is)
-   **Inertia: Stop delay factor** <span style="color:#666">(optional)</span>: <span style="background-color:#fb7">\[ Version 0.36.2+ \]</span>; <span style="color:#BD0058">Positive real number</span>; The delay upon command stop. Note this isn't time in seconds, but are a factor (the lower the value, the more inertia there is)
-   **Inertia: Start function** <span style="color:#666">(optional)</span>: <span style="background-color:#fb7">\[ Version 0.36.2+ \]</span>; <span style="color:#BD0058">String</span>; Specifies what spline should be used for start. See diagram below.
-   **Inertia: Stop function** <span style="color:#666">(optional)</span>: <span style="background-color:#fb7">\[ Version 0.36.2+ \]</span>; <span style="color:#BD0058">String</span>; Specifies what spline should be used for stop. See diagram below.
-   **Affects engine?** <span style="color:#666">(optional)</span>: <span style="background-color:#fb7">\[ Version 0.4.0.5+ \]</span>; <span style="color:#BD0058">Positive real number</span>; <span style="color:#0B8A00">default = 1.0</span>; 0 means that moving this command won't affect engine RPM, so it is independent. Value larger than 0 specifies how much engine power will be needed for this command to move.
-   **Needs engine?** <span style="color:#666">(optional)</span>: <span style="background-color:#fb7">\[ Version 0.4.0.5+ \]</span>; <span style="color:#BD0058">Boolean</span>; <span style="color:#0B8A00">default = true</span>; value of "true" means that the command only works with a running engine. "False" means engine is not needed.

```


NOTE: Both commas and spaces are accepted as delimiters between parameters.

## Rotators

Rotators are alternate commands(hydros) that allows you to do turntables, like in the base of a rotating crane. They use 10 reference nodes:

-   2 nodes to define the axis of rotation
-   4 nodes (must be a square, centered with the axis) to define the baseplate
-   4 nodes (again, a square, centered with the axis) to define the rotating plate.

Then, in a similar way to commands, comes the rate of rotation, and the numbers of the left and right function keys.

New in <span style="background-color:#fb7">\[ Version 0.4+ \]</span>

-   start\_delay. Real, default `0.0`
-   stop\_delay. Real, default `0.0`
-   start\_function.
-   stop\_function.
-   engine\_coupling. Real, default `1.0`
-   needs\_engine. Boolean, default false

Rotators can use [inertia](#inertia).

The reference nodes for the baseplate and rotator plate must also match each other in order. (i.e. if you start at the front left for the base plate and work clockwise, do the same for the rotator plate!) See the example rotators code and attached picture. Both plates must be identical!

```

```

![Rotators](/images/truckfile-rotators.jpg)

## Rotators2

Same as rotators section, but more options that allow lightweight rotators, rotator force setting and tolerance (anti jitter) setting and correct description parsing. Additional options:

-   **Force**: the rotating power of the rotator, default is `10000000`
-   **Tolerance**: anti jitter setting for lightweight rotators, default is `0.0`. Rise gently to make your rotator spawn and rotate stable if needed
-   **Description**: descriptive text visible in the t-screen

```

## Forwardcommands

Forwards the command keys pressed while riding a truck to loads in close proximity. It is used to remote control the commands of a load. The load must have the "importcommands" tag.

```
forwardcommands
```

In 0.4.0.5 and above it is possible to toggle forwardcommands on/off for the current beam object. The standard button assignment for this is `CTRL+SHIFT+F`.

## Importcommands

Enables a load to receive command keys from a manned vehicle in close proximity. The controlling vehicle must have the "forwardcommands" tag. The load only receives the keys that are pressed by the player, it must contain a commands section. Commands section for loads is defined in the same manner as in manned trucks.

```
importcommands
```

In 0.4.0.5 and above it is possible to toggle importcommands on/off for the current beam object. The standard button assignment for this is `CTRL+SHIFT+I`.

## Set\_beam\_defaults

This is not a section, but a self-contained line that can be inserted anywhere in the truck file. It changes all the beams (and the hydros and ropes) declared after this line. You can use this line many times to make different groups of beams that have different characteristics (e.g. stronger chassis, softer cab, etc.).

Parameters:

-   **Springiness**:
        <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>;
        <span style="color:#0B8A00">Default: `9000000`</span>;
        The overall stiffness of a beam. The higher the value the stiffer the beam.
-   **Damping constant**:
        <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>;
        <span style="color:#0B8A00">Default: `12000`</span>;
        The resistance to motion of a beam. Higher values make the beam less likely to deform.
-   **Deformation threshold constant**:
        <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>;
        <span style="color:#0B8A00">Default: `400000`</span>;
        The amount of force that must be applied to a beam before it will not return to its original length. The lower the value, the easier it is to deform.
-   **Breaking threshold constant**:
        <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>;
        <span style="color:#0B8A00">Default: `1000000`</span>;
        The amount of force that must be applied to a beam before it will break.
-   **Beam diameter**:
        <span style="color:#666">(optional)</span>;
        <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>;
        <span style="color:#0B8A00">Default: `0.05` (= 5cm)</span>
        The visual size of a beam in meters. This setting only has a visual effect. Changing it does not modify how a truck will drive.
-   **Beam material**
        <span style="color:#666">(optional)</span>;
        <span style="color:#BD0058">String</span>;
        <span style="color:#0B8A00">Default: <i>tracks/beam</i></span>;
        The material used to color the beam. It must be defined in a separate `.material` file. 
-   **Plastic deformation coefficient**:
        <span style="color:#666">(optional)</span>;
        <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number in range: `0.0` - `1.0`</span>;
        <span style="color:#0B8A00">Default: `0.0`</span>;
        This defines how elastic the deformation of a beam is. It is explained in greater detail below.

To use default values without having to type the numbers, use `-1` in each field. Example:

```
set_beam_defaults -1, -1, -1, -1
```
	
Or if you want to use the default values as a base:

```	
set_beam_defaults 9000000, 12000, 400000, 1000000, 0.05, tracks/beam, 0.0
```

Beware: Excessive spring will result in an unstable chassis. Increasing the damping will help with this, but excessive damping will crash RoR. Higher chassis mass may mitigate that problem if applicable. If you create a light car, you may want to reduce the spring, damping and deformation values to match the real, softer frame of a car, and also increase stability.

Be aware that the current default values are "overspringy", or "underdamped" for stability reasons (that is why trucks often look too springy when they fall down a slope), but on softer designs you can correct this and have a better damping ratio. Missing beam textures may make RoR unstable. Example for a car:

```
;set_beam_defaults spring, damping, deform,  break, diameter, material
set_beam_defaults 3000000,   10000, 100000, 250000,     0.02, tracks/beamblack
```

If you want to keep a rigid chassis base and drivetrain, you can do:

```
beams
;base chassis and drivetrain with the default high-strength settings
1,2
2,3
...
3,4
;car body, softer setting
set_beam_defaults 3000000, 10000, 100000, 250000
5,6
6,7
...
;return to stronger defaults for the rest (e.g. hydros)
set_beam_defaults -1, -1, -1, -1
...
```

If you want to to make something deform well (like for flexbodies), use these settings for the beam group you want to deform together with the global [enable\_advanced\_deformation](#enable_advanced_deformation) option to unleash unlimited beam physics for best results in crash deformation:

```
;set_beam_defaults spring, damping, deform,  break, diameter,         material, deform_coef
set_beam_defaults 3000000,   10000, 100000, 250000,     0.02, tracks/beamblack,         0.9
```

The plastic deformation coefficient is `0.0` by default (elastic deformation). By setting it as property you can tune the related beam group to your needs. 

For example, if a cube made of nodes and beams is crashed to a wall, then the placement of the nodes are displaced, altering the original shape to an irregular one. 

This also affects the length of beams, if nodes are displaced, the beams may conform to a new shorter or longer length, and staying that way until another outside force is applied. 

Valid values: `0.0` - `1.0`, do not exceed that range! A plastic deformation coefficient setting of `0.0` is close to the original beam behavior of RoR 0.36.2 (quite elastic). `1.0` is close to the maximum plastic deformation you were able to reach with the former experimental `enable_advanced_deformation` patch. 

Never use a break setting lower then a deform setting! This will result in a beam breaking instantly when it starts deforming!

## Set\_beam\_defaults\_scale

This is not a section, but a self-contained line that can be inserted anywhere in the truck file. It changes the scale of all following `set_beam_defaults` lines to a certain factor:

-   **Springiness** - Scale: 0-1
-   **Damping constant** - Scale: 0-1
-   **Deformation threshold constant** - Scale: 0-1
-   **Breaking threshold constant** - Scale: 0-1

The default is all 1 for all arguments.

```
set_beam_defaults_scale 1, 1, 1, 1
```

Example that scales spring to 50%:

```
set_beam_defaults_scale 0.5, 1, 1, 1
```

Take note:

-   Unlike `set_beam_defaults`, you must always give all four arguments. Its not possible to leave some out.
-   Any `set_beam_defaults` line that is scaled will output a line to `RoR.log` saying `Due to using set_beam_defaults_scale, this set_beam_defaults was interpreted as ...`

## Set\_node\_defaults

This is a directive which affects all nodes (including wheel and camera nodes) declared on lines below it. 
You can use this line many times to make different groups of nodes that have different characteristics (e.g. more grip for wheels, more surface drag for chassis nodes, etc.). 

The parameters are:

-   **loadweight**:
        <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>;
        <span style="color:#0B8A00">Default: `0.0`</span>; 
        The default loadweight mass applied to a node. Will be overridden by a per node definition (the option `l`).
        Minimass calculation is unaffected.
-   **friction**:
        <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>;
        <span style="color:#0B8A00">Default: `1.0`</span>; 
        The amount to multiply the node's friction by. 
        A setting of `2` will double the friction; a setting of `0` will create a frictionless node.
-   **volume**:
        <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>;
        <span style="color:#0B8A00">Default: `1.0`</span>; 
        The amount to multiply the node's buoyancy. 
        A setting of `2` will double the buoyancy; a setting of `0` will create a non-buoyant node. This only applies when the node is in a fluid.
-   **surface**:
        <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>;
        <span style="color:#0B8A00">Default: `1.0`</span>; 
        The amount to multiply the node's surface by. 
        A setting of `2` will double the surface; a setting of `0` will create a node with no surface. This only applies when the node is in a fluid.
-   **options**:
        <span style="color:#666">(optional)</span>;
        <span style="color:#BD0058">Options string</span>;
        Set any node-option property as default. You do not need to set the `l` property if a default loadweight is set.

Important: Buoyancy volume and drag surface settings only have effect on fluids defined in `ground_models.cfg` (mud definitions), so right now they do not work with the standard RoR Water.

To use default values without having to type the numbers, use "-1" in each field. For example:

```
set_node_defaults -1, -1, -1, -1
```

Beware: Excessive friction, surface and volume will result in an unstable node/beam structure when driving in mud. If your wheels/truck explodes when driving from solid ground onto mud, lower the friction and/or volume setting. If a wheel cracks while in the mud, lower the volume and/or the surface setting.

Syntax is `set_node_defaults loadweight, traction, buoyancy, surface`

Mud tire example, unloaded, increased traction, higher buoyancy, higher drag surface and set to extra per node buoyancy:

```
set_node_defaults -1, 1.1, 5, 1.25, b
```

Chassis, loaded with `5` kg per node, reduced traction, no buoyancy, higher drag surface:

```
set_node_defaults 5, 0.5, 0, 2
```

Tracks example, high traction, low buoyancy, low surface, loaded with `50` kg per node:

```
set_node_defaults 50, 1.2, 0.3, 0.5
```

Steam boat paddlewheel, loaded with `75` kg per node, no traction, no buoyancy, high drag surface:

```
set_node_defaults 75, 0, 0, 3
```

Ccontactless with default settings:

```
set_node_defaults -1, -1, -1, -1, c
```

The new `L` node option will help to understand and use `set_node_defaults`, `p` node option will boost fps even with tracked vehicles on slower computers. See: [nodes](#nodes)

## Enable\_advanced\_deformation

This is not a section, but a self-contained line that can be inserted anywhere in the truck file. It changes the general beams deformation physics.

Use this only once per truck file, it's a general activation and setting of advanced beam physics . Its recommended to place the enable\_advanced\_deformation before the first beams section in your truck-file.

Truck file syntax:

```
enable_advanced_deformation
```

This will remove any limit and thresholds from the [set\_beam\_defaults](#set_beam_defaults) processing. Its recommended to use it for the development of properly deforming flexbody node\\beam structures.

## Rollon

**NOTE: This directive has no effect as of version 0.39.5+**

Enables collision between wheels and the contactable textured surfaces of a truck.

```
rollon
```

## Contacters

The contacters section lists the nodes that may contact with cab triangles. This concerns only contacts with other trucks or loads. You can easily omit this section at first.

```

## Triggers

Triggers are special beams which trigger user-specified events when extended/contracted to a given bound. They have no physics attributes and can extend indefinitely.

Parameters:

-   **Node 1**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Node number/name</span>; The node where the trigger beam starts.
-   **Node 2**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Node number/name</span>; The node where the trigger beam ends.
-   **contraction\_trigger\_limit**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>; The length when the shortkey command gets triggered
-   **extension\_trigger\_limit**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>; The length when the longkey command gets triggered
-   **shortbound\_trigger\_action**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Positive or negative Decimal number</span>; On normal triggers without a special option this represents the command key to be triggered at shortbound (1 - 48 <span style="background-color:#fb7">\[ Version 0.4.0.7+ \]</span> 1 - 84). For other trigger types, look below.
-   **longbound\_trigger\_action**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Positive or negative Decimal number</span>; On normal triggers without a special option this represents the command key to be triggered at longbound (1 - 48 <span style="background-color:#fb7">\[ Version 0.4.0.7+ \]</span> 1 - 84). For other trigger types, look below.
-   **options** <span style="color:#666">(optional)</span>: <span style="color:#BD0058">String</span>
    -   `i`: Makes the trigger beam invisible
    -   `c`: Set the boundary calculation to command-style, just for convenience
    -   `x`: Set the trigger to disabled on startup ( default = `enabled` ), will get useless after first activation by a triggerblocker
    -   `b`: Blocks other commandkeys, shortkey at shortbound, longkey at longbound. If longkey is set to `-1`, shortkey will get blocked at short and at longbound. It does not block of manual user inputs, just triggers.
    -   `B`: Blocks other triggers when triggered, a number in shortkey represent the number of triggers to block at shortbound , a number in longkey the number of triggers to release at longbound.
    -   `A`: <span style="background-color:#fb7">\[ Version 0.38.23+ \]</span> Same as the Blocker `B`, but inverted activation. Will block while between shotbound and longbound a number of triggers (shortkey) and release if not (longkey).
    -   `s`: Switches commandnumbers when triggered set in shortkey and longkey. Good to build wipers or similar, see examples
    -   `h`: <span style="background-color:#fb7">\[ Version 0.38.26+ \]</span> You can use triggers to lock or unlock hookgroups ( only hookgroups &lt;= `-3` ); Unlocks hookgroups shortkey at shortbound and hookgroup longkey at longbound.
    -   `H`: <span style="background-color:#fb7">\[ Version 0.38.26+ \]</span> You can use triggers to lock or unlock hookgroups ( only hookgroups &lt;= `-3` ); Locks hookgroups shortkey at shortbound and hookgroup longkey at longbound.
    -   `t`: <span style="background-color:#fb7">\[ Version 0.4.0.7+ \]</span> Continuous trigger, delivers a value of `0` below and at shortbound, a value of `1` over and at longbound. Between these boundaries, this trigger will deliver a value between `0` and `1` (linear), depending on the current position. See "engine trigger" for details on how to use this.
    -   `E`: <span style="background-color:#fb7">\[ Version 0.4.0.7+ \]</span> Engine trigger. This trigger gives you control over various vehicle driving functions. It is recommended to use this in combination with a `t`-trigger to get precise, continous control. Works as follows:
        -   ''' *(remapped)* shortbound\_trigger\_action''': <span style="color:#BD0058">Positive decimal number</span> Takes the number of the engine to be controlled, starting with `0`. As RoR only supports one engine per vehicle at the moment, always put `0` here.
        -   ''' *(remapped)* longbound\_trigger\_action''': <span style="color:#BD0058">Positive decimal number</span> Takes the number of the function you want to control:
            -   `0`: Clutch
            -   `1`: Brake
            -   `2`: Accelerator
            -   `3`: RPM Control (not available at the moment)
            -   `4`: Shift Up (use no "t"-trigger here). Will shift up on short and longbound.
            -   `5`: Shift Down (use no "t"-trigger here). Will shift down on short and longbound.
    -   **boundary\_timer** <span style="color:#666">(optional)</span>: <span style="color:#BD0058">Positive real number</span>; <span style="color:#0B8A00">default = `1.0`</span>; Represents the time a boundarycheck is disabled for trigger switches ( option `s` ) to avoid lockup.

## Lockgroups

This section defines lockgroups for nodes. It has to be AFTER the [nodes](#nodes) section

Lockgroup Default = `-1`, all nodes can be locked by standard hooks with no special lockgroup set

**Important:**

-   *Special lockgroup*: `9999` skip the node from any locking attempts
-   *POSITIVE* lockgroups are free to use, the negative range is reserved for RoR built in standard lock-setups.

```
lockgroups
;lockgroup,  nodeIDs
; node 5 added to lockgroup 1
1,        5
;nodes 6, 7, 9 added to lockgroup 2
2,  7, 6, 9
```

Performance boost option (needs to be BEFORE the [nodes](#nodes) section):

```
lockgroup_default_nolock
```

This will set all nodes to `9999` (deny locking) of the truck by default.

Any lockgroups defined later in the truck will override this setting for the specified node.

Allows you to define exactly where standard hooks can lock to your truck and boost performance a lot when autolock hooks are used.

**Its recommended to use this option as default.**

## Hooks

This section defines special options for hooknodes setup in the nodes section. It has to be placed after the nodes section.

-   *id*: A node number to identify the hooknode the options apply to. The node number needs to exist and it has to be a hooknode with option `h`
-   *options*: no order needed, just place what you need, here is a list of possible options:
    -   `hookrange:` The range a hook scans for a valid node to lock to, Default: `0.4`
    -   `speedcoef:` The speed a hook pulls the node to lock into locking position. Default: `1.0`
    -   `maxforce:` The force limit where a locking attempt is canceled. Default: `100000000.0`
    -   `hookgroup:` The hookgroup a hook belongs to. Standard hook: `-1` (Default), Reserved for autolock: `-2`, any special hookgroup for triggerd hooks `-3` or less. Only signed integer are valid. Keyword variants: *`hookgroup` / `hgroup`*
    -   `lockgroup:` The lockgroup a hook belongs to. Lock everything: `-1` (Default), all other numbers the hook will lock only to a node with the same lockgroup set. Only signed integer are valid. Keyword variants: *`lockgroup` / `lgroup`*
        - **Lockgroup `9999` is reseved for nodes that are skipped while locking attempts. Do NOT use lockgroup `9999` with a hook.**
    -   `timer:` Delay timer for autolocking hooks before they attempt to relock. Default: `5.0`. Only positive settings are valid
    -   `self-lock:` This hook can lock to the truck its placed on too. Keyword variants: *`self-lock`/ `selflock` / `self_lock`*
    -   `auto-lock:` This hook will lock automatically to valid nodes in range. Keyword variants: *`auto-lock` / `autolock` / `auto_lock:`*
    -   `nodisable:` When the force limit defined by maxforce is exceed the locking attempt will NOT disable the linkage beam, but the hook node will stop pulling the node to lock. Works similar to ties then. Variants: *`nodisable` / `no-disable` / `no_disable`*
    -   `shortlimit`: Minimum range in meters the hook will pull the node to lock to. Default = `0.0`. Keyword variants: *`shortlimit` / `short_limit`*
    -   `norope`: Linkage between hook and node to be locked will act like a beam and not like a rope. Variants: *`norope` / `no-rope` / `no_rope`*
    -   `visible`: Linkage between hook and node will be visible while locking process and locked. Variants: *`visible` / `vis`*

```
hooks
; id, options
;standard hook, increased scanrange
144, hookrange: 2.15
;as above, but will cancel locking attempt if pulling force exceeds 100k
145, hookrange: 2.15, maxforce: 100000
;triggered hook, locks 50% faster, is autlocking with a delay-timer of 7.5 seconds, belongs to hookgroup 12 ( for tiggers with option ''h'' or ''H'' ) and will only lock to nodes with lockgroup 2 set
146, speedcoef: 1.5, auto-lock, timer: 7.5, hookgroup: -12, lockgroup: 2
```

Standard hooks toggle with `L`, autolock and triggerd hooks detach with `ALT+L` manually.

Hooks with hookgroups < `-2` can only be locked automatically or by a trigger.

## Slide Nodes

These are nodes which can slide freely along a 'rail', which is a sequence of connected beams. It's a simple constraining mechanism that introduces new possibilities into RoR and simplifies many existing mechanical structures.

There are 2 ways to define a rail:
* To specify it in <span style="font-family: monospace;">**slidenodes**</span> section as a second parameter.

-   To specify it in <span style="font-family: monospace;">**railgroup**</span> section and reference it in <span style="font-family: monospace;">**slidenodes**</span> using <span style="font-family: monospace;">**railgroup\_id**</span> parameter.

A slidenode without a rail is invalid, naturally.

Parameters:

-   **slide\_node**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Node number/name</span>; A node to become slide-node.
-   **rail\_nodes (<u>sequence</u>)** <span style="color:#666">(optional)</span>: <span style="color:#BD0058">Comma-separated list of nodes</span>; <span style="color:#0B8A00">default = none, expects <span style="font-family: monospace;">**railgroup\_id:**</span> to be used</span>; Nodes forming a rail the node can slide along. Each two consecutive nodes from this list must have a beam defined between them; for example a list containing `7, 8, 9, 10` would require beams `7` - `8`, `8` - `9`, `9` - `10` to be defined.
-   **s (spring\_rate)** <span style="color:#666">(optional)</span>: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number prefixed with 's' or 'S'</span>; <span style="color:#0B8A00">default = 9000000</span>; Force that holds the node to the rail (in N/m). Write as: `s10.98`
-   **b (break\_force)** <span style="color:#666">(optional)</span>: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number prefixed with 'b' or 'B'</span>; <span style="color:#0B8A00">default = infinity (never)</span>; Force at which the node will separate from the rail (in N). Write as: `b10.98`
-   **t (tolerance)** <span style="color:#666">(optional)</span>: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number prefixed with 't' or 'T'</span>; <span style="color:#0B8A00">default = `0`</span>; Distance from the rail before rail forces are applied to the node.
-   **g (railgroup\_id)** <span style="color:#666">(optional)</span>: <span style="color:#BD0058">Positive decimal prefixed with 'g' or 'G'</span>; <span style="color:#0B8A00">default = `none`, expects <span style="font-family: monospace;">**rail\_nodes:**</span> to be used.</span>; <span style="font-family: monospace;">**railgroup**</span> defining a rail. Write as: `g2`
-   **r (attachment\_rate)** <span style="color:#666">(optional)</span>: <span style="background-color:#fb7">\[ Version 0.4+ \]</span> <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number prefixed with 'r' or 'R'</span>; <span style="color:#0B8A00">default = disabled</span>; Attachment rate in seconds. Write as: `r2.3`
-   **d (max\_attachment\_distance)** <span style="color:#666">(optional)</span>: <span style="background-color:#fb7">\[ Version 0.4+ \]</span> <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number prefixed with 'd' or 'D'</span>; <span style="color:#0B8A00">default = 0.1</span>; Maximum attachment Distance in meters. Write as: `d0.23`

## slidenode_connect_instantly

To be documented.

## Rail Groups

Allows specifying a separate rail which can be linked to slidenode(s) later.

Parameters:

-   **rail\_group\_id**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Positive decimal number</span>; ID of this railgroup.
-   **rail\_nodes (<u>sequence</u>)**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Comma-separated list of \[nodes/node-ranges\]</span>; Nodes forming a rail the node can slide along. Each two consecutive nodes from this list must have a beam defined between them; for example a list containing `7, 8, 9, 10` would require beams `7` - `8`, `8` - `9`, `9` - `10` to be defined. Ranges are supported (for example: `1-10`)

```
railgroups
;railgroupID, node id list
1,  7, 8, 9, 10

slidenodes
;id, railgroupID
1,          g1
```

To create a looped rail group, simply make the last node of the list the same as the first node of the list. Please note that all segments must have beams defined.

```
railgroups
;railgroupID, node id list
1,  7, 8, 9, 7

slidenodes
;id, railgroupID
1, g1
```

## Detacher\_group

This section defines group of the beams that are deleted if one beam in this group breaks. Very useful for detaching parts of the truck like bumpers, doors, wheels etc. falling of the truck when crashing. All kinds of beams can be set to a detacher\_group except wheel generation section, these one will always be "default" to avoid deleting the axle of the wheel which results in a crash.

**Valid detacher group numbers:** any positive or negative integer

**Valid end lines:** `detacher_group 0`, `detacher_group end`

Group `0` its the default setting and means **no group** set and is used to end groups.

Use positive group numbers for master beams and negative ones for minor beams. A master detacher-beam breaking will brake all beams with the sames group number and all minor beams with the same negative group number (abs(detacher\_group)). A minor beam will not break any other beams at all, its just set to break with a group of beams if a master detacher-beam in its group breaks.

```
beams
detacher_group 1
0,    1
detacher_group 0
2,    4
3,    5
detacher_group 1
6,    8
7,    9
10,   12
detacher_group 2
11,   13
detacher_group 0
22,   14
detacher_group -1
16,   17
detacher_group 0
```
     

This will add beams `0,1` + `6,8` + `7,9` + `10,12` to group `1`, beam `16,17` to group `1(minor)` and beam `11,13` to group `2`. Breaking beam `16,17` will not break any other beam. Breaking beam `6,8` i.e, will break and disable beams `0,1` + `7,9` + `10,12` + `16,17` too in the same simulation cycle.

## Ropes

Ropes are special beams that have no compression strength (they can shorten easily) but have standard extension strength, like a cable or a chain. They have also another peculiarity: the second node can "grab" the nearest reachable ropable node with the `O` key. Standard use is to use a chassis node as the first node, and a "free" node as the second node (free as in not attached by any other beam). The best example of this are the chains of the Multibennes truck.

Option: `i` for invisible <span style="background-color:#fb7">\[ Version 0.38.18+ \]</span>

```
ropes
;order is important: root->end
116,134
130,136, i
116,135
130,137
```

## Fixes

Fixes are nodes that are fixed in place. That means that once put in place in the terrain, they will never move, whatever happens. 

This is useful for making fixed scenery elements from beams, like bridges. 

Just add the node number that you want to fix.

```
fixes
2
3
12
```

## Minimass

This sets the minimum node mass. Useful for very light vehicles with lots of nodes (e.g. small airplanes).

(Tip: When using a very low minimass, i.e. below `10`, you should use a low damping value in the [Beam defaults](#set_beam_defaults) in your beams section)

```
minimass
10.0
```

## Ties

Ties are special beams that have no compression strength (they can shorten easily) but have standard extension strength, like a cable or a chain.

Like ropes, ties grab the nearest reachable ropable node with the `O` key. But there is a twist: unlike ropes, they disappear when not attached (because they have no extremity node at rest) and they automatically shorten until the extension forces reaches a threshold. They are very useful to solidly strap a load to a chassis.

Parameters:

-   **Root node**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Node number/name</span>; The root node (the starting point of the beam)
-   **Max. reach length**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>; The maximum reach length
-   **Auto shorten rate**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>; The rate of auto-shortening
-   **Min. length**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>; The shortest length possible (proportional to original length; `1.0` means no shortening)
-   **Max. length**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>; The greatest length possible (proportional to original length; `1.0` means no extension; recommended you keep it as `1.0`).
-   **Options** <span style="color:#666">(optional)</span>: <span style="color:#BD0058">String</span>; <span style="color:#0B8A00">default = `n`</span>
    -   `n`: Visible (default)
    -   `i`: Invisible.
-   **Max. stress** <span style="color:#666">(optional)</span>: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>; <span style="color:#0B8A00">default = 12000</span>; The force (in Newtons) when the ties stop to shorten.
-   **Group** <span style="color:#666">(optional)</span>: <span style="color:#BD0058">Positive decimal number</span>; <span style="color:#0B8A00">default = `none`</span>

```
ties
;root, max len, rate, short, long (, flag, max_stress, group)
58,     1.5,  0.5,   0.3,  1.0
62,     1.5,  0.5,   0.3,  1.0
59,     1.5,  0.5,   0.3,  1.0
63,     1.5,  0.5,   0.3,  1.0, n, 5000, 2
```

## Ropables

This section lists the nodes that can be caught by ropes or ties. Good use is to define some ropable nodes at the front and back of the truck to allow towing the truck.

```
ropables
;node-id, group, multilock
0,     0,         0
1,    -1
```

The group and multilock arguments are only available in RoR 0.36.3 and later.

-   Group:
    -   Default: `-1` = all groups.
-   Multilock:
    -   `0`=disable, `1`=enable: This specifies if this ropable can be locked by many ties/ropes.

## Particles

This enables/disables a particle cannon in the game (with the `G` key).

```
particles
;source, back reference,  particle_system_name
19,              5,  tracks/particles/water1
19,              5,  tracks/particles/waterGreen
16,              3,  tracks/particles/water1
16,              3,  tracks/particles/waterRed
```

(You can create your own particle. A template can be found in `Rigs of Rods\resources\particles.zip\water.particle`)

## Torque Curve

Torque curves affect the behavior of the engine. This section allows you to assign predefined or user-defined torque curve to a truck. It can be used in 2 ways:

## Usage \#1: Predefined curve

-   **curve\_name**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Torque curve name</span>; <span style="color:#0B8A00">default = default</span>; Predefined options are: `default`, `diesel`, `turbodiesel`, `gas`, `turbogas`, `wheelloader`, `compacttractor`, `tractor`, `hydrostatic`.

```
    torquecurve
    turbogas
```

## Usage \#2: Defining custom curve

-   **power**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>; RPM where the power begins
-   **torque\_percentage**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>; Power as a percent of total torque specified in [section "engine"](#engine) parameter \#3 "Torque" (0 = 0%, `0.5` = 50%, `1.5` = 150%)

It's suitable to define the torque to the engine RPM set in the engine definition plus 25% ( multiply the value with 1.25) to get the overev area defined.

The following example would be good for a maximum engine RPM set to 2800:

```
torquecurve
   0, 0.00
1000, 0.79
1500, 0.90
2000, 0.97
2500, 0.99
3000, 0.90
3500, 0.77
```

Engine dying in idle and first gear? Just define a single higher peak value where you want the engine to idle... like adding:

```
...
700, 0.2
800, 0.6
900, 0.4
...
```

![Torque curve](/images/truckfile-torquecurve.png) to the example above in the right spot will result the engine idle a little bit higher then `800` rpm in first gear.

The example to the left shows a screenshot of a torquecurve made for a small diesel engine:

Idle: `~600` RPM, Max @ `1900` RPM, slight and constant torque increase over the used RPM bandwidth, hard torque drop off in the over-rev area.

## Cruise Control

This section offers options to the cruise control feature (activated by pressing space bar):

-   **lower limit**: Sets the minimum speed cruise control can be activated. Unit is meters per second (divide kph by `3.6`. Example: `36` kph/`3.6` =`10` mps)
-   **auto brake**: If activated, the vehicle brakes if velocity is faster than set in cruise control. `0`=auto brake off, `1`=auto brake on

```
;cruisecontrol lowlimit autobrake
cruisecontrol        10         1
```

In the example above, minimum speed for cruise control to be activated is `10`mps (`36`kph). The auto brake feature is activated.

## Speedlimiter

Limits the speed of a vehicle. If the speed is above the limit, the vehicle will not accelerate any further. 

Insert the limit in meters per second (divide kph by `3.6`. Example: `36` kph/`3.6` =`10` mps)

```
;speedlimiter <speed in m/s>
speedlimiter 10
```

In the example above, the maximum speed of the vehicle is `10`mps (`36`kph), it will not accelerate any further.

## Axles

This section defines axles on a vehicle, allowing more accurate distribution of torque among the wheels.

The axle section introduces open differentials, and spooled (aka locked) differentials. They are toggled with the `W` key.

By adding axles to your vehicle file you override the propulsed property for the tires. Only wheels connected to an axle are powered, if multiple axles are defined the axles are interconnected in a locked manner. If no axle section is defined the old model of equal power distribution is used. 

Because the axle sections looks up already defined wheels, **it must be defined AFTER the wheels have been defined.**

The axle section is different from other sections in that it is broken into properties. Properties are not order dependent. Currently the available properties are:

-   **w1(&lt;node1&gt; &lt;node2&gt;)** - This defines which wheel the axle is attached to, **&lt;node1&gt;** and **&lt;node2&gt;** Refer to the node1 and node2 as defined in the wheel section
-   **w2(&lt;node1&gt; &lt;node2&gt;)** - Wheel 2, same as w1, this is the second wheel attached to the axle. `w1` and `w2` are interchangeable.
-   **d(type)** - Defines the available differential types for this axle. the list of axles is cycled through in the order specified, differential types maybe specified more than once. Each differential type is specified by a single letter, the letters are not to be separated by spaces or any other character. If no differentials are specified the axles will default to opened and locked.
    -   **Available differential types**
        -   `o` - Open
        -   `l` - Locked (wheels locked together regardless of torque input)
        -   `s` - Split evenly (each wheel gets equal torque regardless of wheel speed)
        -   `v` - Viscous <span style="background-color:#fb7">\[ Version 0.4.8.0+ \]</span> (applies locking force based on the amount of torque)
		
Sample axle section:

```
axles
; axle 1
w1(1 2), w2(3 4), d(ol)
; axle 2
w1(5 6), w2(7 8), d(l)
```

## Interaxles

In <span style="background-color:#fb7">\[ Version 0.4.8.0+ \]</span> and above you can define inter axle differentials on a vehicle, allowing more accurate distribution of torque among the axles. They are toggled with `ALT+W`.

Parameters:

-   **axle_1**: The number of the first axle, with the first defined axle starting at `1`.
-   **axle_2**: The number of the second axle, with the first defined axle starting at `1`.
-   **d(type)**: Similar to the `axles` section

Sample interaxles section:

```
interaxles
; axle_1, axle_2, d(type)
2, 3, d(vlso)
```

## Transfercase

In <span style="background-color:#fb7">\[ Version 0.4.8.0+ \]</span> and above you can add a transfer case on a vehicle.

Parameters:

-   **axle_1**: The number of the first axle, the one which is always driven.
-   **axle_2**: The number of the second axle, the one which is only driven in 4WD mode.
-   **2wd_mode**: Allows/disallows 2WD mode. 
-   **2wd_lo_mode**: Allows/disallows 2WD Lo mode. 
-   **gear_ratio(s)**: Alternate gear ratios in Lo mode. If none are specified, Lo mode will be disabled.

Notes:

- 	Requires an `axles` section defined first!
- 	`CTRL+W` switches between 2WD/4WD mode.
- 	If alternate gear ratios are specified, `SHIFT+W` switches between Hi/Lo mode.

Sample transfercase section:

```
;Basic transfer case, no alternate ratio(s) 

transfercase
;default driven axle, alternate axle, has 2wd mode, has 2wd lo mode
1, 2, 1, 0

;Transfer case with alternate ratio(s)

transfercase
;default driven axle, alternate axle, has 2wd mode, has 2wd lo mode, alternate ratio(s)
2, 1, 1, 0, 4.11, 3.1, 2.72
```

## Wheeldetachers

<span style="background-color:#fb7">\[ Version 0.4.7.0+ \]</span> this section allows you to disable power to a wheel when a [detacher_group](#detacher_group) breaks.

```
wheeldetachers
;wheel_id, detacher_group
1, 1
2, 2
```

Parameters:

-   **wheel_id**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>; The wheel number, with the first defined wheel starting at `1`.
-   **detacher_group**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>; The d`etacher_group` number. 

Example usage:

```
beams
;front right wheel
set_beam_defaults 12500000, 28600, 1860000, 6968000
detacher_group 1
1, 2, i

```

## Collisionboxes

In RoR 0.4.0.5 and above you can define collisionboxes. In earlier versions of RoR, there was only one bounding box for truck activation per object, which was defined by the outermost nodes. With collisionboxes, you get the ability to define the nodes that should be used for the activation bounding box calculation. It is also possible to define multiple bounding boxes, for example to exclude some areas from activation.

Syntax:

```
collisionboxes
;node id list box 1
48, 58, 59, 67
;node id list box 2
5, 6
...
;node id list box n
...
```

Collisionboxes can give you a huge performance increase in situations where many beam objects would have been activated before, for example a container crane with many containers underneath.

## Rescuer

```
rescuer
```

This single keyword placed in the truck file will make the truck a rescuer, like the Scania Wrecker. These vehicles can be entered by pressing `R`.

# Look & Feel

## Managedmaterials

Managed materials helps you to use complex material effects (for example reflective materials like chromes, dynamic damage materials) without having to deal with the technical complexity of writing a shader for Ogre3D. Rigs of Rods comes with a set of standard shader effects, and with the Managedmaterial section you can pick the effect you want and adapt it for your vehicle. The shader library will grow with time, so the set of effects available in this section will grow with time.

The generic format of this section is:

-   **Material name** - The name of the material you are creating. You can use this material for any of your meshes (flexmeshes, props, etc.). This material name **must not be defined anywhere else** (for example in a .material file).
-   **Effect name** - The name of the effect you want to use. Valid names are defined below.
-   **Effect parameters** - A variable number of parameters, depending on the effect your are using. See below for the description.

Do not use a comma to separate parameters in a managedmaterial section! Also, you must declare your managed material before they are used. That means that the managedmaterial section should come before the flexmesh, props, wheels, or any section that will use this material.

Currently available effects:

-   **flexmesh\_standard** - This effect defines an opaque, reflective and damageable material for flexmeshes. This will work only for flexmeshes! It takes 3 parameters:

1.  A standard texture name: this is the base, undamaged texture. (The diffuse map.)
2.  A damaged texture name (or `-` if no damage texture): Should be similar to the standard texture, but with damage.
3.  A specular map texture name (or `-` if no specular map texture): a greyscale image that maps the "shininess" of the material, from dark for matte to white for chromed. Technically this isn't a specular map but a reflectivity map.

-   **flexmesh\_transparent** - This effect defines a semi-transparent, reflective and damageable material for flexmeshes. This will work only for flexmeshes! It takes 3 parameters:

1.  A standard texture name: this is the base, undamaged texture. The alpha channel of this texture is used to define transparency. (The diffuse map.)
2.  A damaged texture name (or `-` if no damage texture): Should be similar to the standard texture, but with damage.
3.  A specular map texture name (or `-` if no specular map texture): A greyscale image that maps the "shininess" of the material, from dark for matte to white for chromed. Again, technically this isn't a specular map but instead a reflectivity map.

-   **mesh\_standard** - This effect defines an opaque, reflective material for any mesh (e.g. wheel rims, props, etc.) It takes 2 parameters:

1.  a standard texture name: This is the base texture.
2.  a specular map texture name (or `-` if no specular map texture): A greyscale image that maps the "shininess" of the material, from dark for matte to white for chromed.

-   **mesh\_transparent** - This effect defines a semi-transparent, reflective material for any mesh (e.g. windows) It takes 2 parameters:

1.  a standard texture name: This is the base, undamaged texture. The alpha channel of this texture is used to define transparency.
2.  a specular map texture name (or `-` if no specular map texture): A greyscale image that maps the "shininess" of the material, from dark for matte to white for chromed.

**WARNING: Your texture file names must not start with `-`. The parser would treat the `-` as "no texture placeholder" and ignore the rest.**

Examples:

```
managedmaterials
;new_material    effect               parameters...
mainbody flexmesh_standard    mytruckbody.png mytruckbody-dmg.png mytruckbody-spec.png
windows   flexmesh_transparent mytruckbody.png mytruckbody-dmg.png mytruckbody-spec.png
wheels    mesh_standard        mytruckwheels.png mytruckwheels-spec.png
```

A note about shaders for power-users: 

You can still use your own, non managed, Cg shaders by manually defining your `.material`, `.program` and `.cg`. Consult the Ogre3D documentation for more details. 

If you think you have made a good shader that can be helpful to other modders, submit it to [GitHub](https://github.com/RigsOfRods/rigs-of-rods) for inclusion to the managedmaterial library of RoR.

## Set\_managedmaterials\_options

This specifies options for all <u>FOLLOWING</u> managed material lines.

Parameters:

-   **doublesided**: <span style="color:#BD0058">`0` (single sided) or `1` (double sided)</span>; <span style="color:#0B8A00">default = `0` (single sided)</span>; . Determines if the mesh should be visible from both sides or not.
    IMPORTANT: This parameter treats `1` as "yes" and anything else as "no". This is required for backwards compatibility.

```
; set_managedmaterials_options doublesided
set_managedmaterials_options 1
```

## Flares

Flares allow you to add lights to your truck. They work as light sources in OGRE and will illuminate other objects (if enabled in settings).

See also: [Flares Tutorial](/vehicle-creation/flares)

Parameters:

-   **Reference node**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Node ID</span>; Node which defines origin of flare-placement coordinate system
-   **X axis node**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Node ID</span>; Node which defines X-axis of flare-placement coordinate system
-   **Y axis node**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Node ID</span>; Node which defines Y-axis of flare-placement coordinate system
-   **Flare X offset**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>; Flare position on X axis in % of distance from ref-node to X-node
-   **Flare Y offset**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>; Flare position on Y axis in % of distance from ref-node to Y-node
-   **Type**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Character</span>; <span style="color:#0B8A00">default = f (headlight)</span>; Type of flare
    -   `f` (default mode when not stated): Headlight.
    -   `b` : Brakelight.
    -   `l` : Left blinker.
    -   `r` : Right blinker.
    -   `R` : Reverse light (on when driving in R gear)
    -   `u` : User controlled light. (i.e. fog light) (see control numbers)
-   **Control number**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Decimal number</span>; - This determines how this light is switched on and off, if you chose a user controlled light. Valid user defined control numbers are `0-500`. If you chose a non-user controlled light(i.e. brake light) you should put `-1` here. `1` would be `CTRL+1`, `2` would be `CTRL+2`, and so on.
 
Some custom control numbers found in 0.38+:
    
	-   `11` Clutch
    -   `12` Parking Brake
    -   `40` Starter
    -   `45` Axle Lock
    -   `55` Steer right
    -   `56` Steer left
    -   `65` Hide GUI
	
-   **Blink delay (miliseconds)**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Decimal number</span>; <span style="color:#0B8A00">default = `-2` (special)</span>; &lt;!--

--&gt;This defines how long the delay is between the light changes in milliseconds. A value of 500 means that the light is 500ms on and 500ms off. Use a value of 0 to create a non-blinking light.

-   -   Special value: `-1` to use the default value of 500ms.
    -   Special value: `-2` non-blinking light except blinkers, which will have default 500ms.
-   **Flare size**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>; This determines how big the flare will be. Reasonable values are between `0.1` and `5` (`0.1` = 10% of default size). If the size is smaller then `0`, then the flare will be independent of the camera angle. (So the flare does not get smaller when you move the camera)
-   **Material Name**: <span style="color:#BD0058">String</span>; This field determines what material should be used for the flare display. If you want to use the standard material, use `default`. Please note that there is not comma between the material name and the size argument. You can use `tracks/aimflare` to position your flare.

## Flares2

Flares2 are the same as normal flares, except that they add an offset-z argument in between:

```

51,  1, 79,    0.23,    0.50,    0.50,    b,            -1,        300,  0.2 myTruck/MyBrakeFlare
```

## Materialflarebindings

See also: [Flares Tutorial](/vehicle-creation/flares)

This can bind a material to a flare, so that the material changes with the flare's on/off status.

The format is as follows:

-   **flare number**: Counting starts from zero. Just count down your flares in the flares section to find the correct number.
-   **material name**: The material that you want to change. It must contain one technique, one pass and a special Texture Unit State (see below for an example)

```
flares
51,1,79, 0.23, 0.50, b, -1, 300, 0.2 myTruck/MyBrakeFlare

materialflarebindings
1, myBrakeMaterial
```

The material must use an animated texture, as shown below:

```
material myBrakeMaterial
{
    technique
    {
        pass
        {
            texture_unit
            {
                anim_texture truck_brake_material.png 2 0
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Put the off-state of the brakelight into the file `truck_brake_material_0.png` and the on-state into `truck_brake_material_1.png`. The `2` and `0` at the end should not be changed. 

This section should be after the flares section and before the props and flexbodies section in order for the lights to work properly.

COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Parameters \#1 and \#2 can also be separated by just space, the parser will silently accept it.

## Props

This allows you to "stick" any 3D mesh to a triangle of points of a truck. You can use it to stick air intakes, horns, seats, dashboard, bumpers, whatever to the truck. Note that there will be no collision detection with these objects. Like flares, they use a vector coordinate system instead of normal right-angle coordinates. Props are positioned relative to 3 nodes of the chassis: One node is the reference node, and the two others define a base (x,y). Props are positioned relative to the reference node by adding proportions of the vectors ref-&gt;X, ref-&gt;Y, with the normal being used as well.

Parameters are:

-   **reference\_node**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Node number/name</span>; The base node, used to define the coordinate system
-   **x\_direction\_node**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Node number/name</span>; The node that defines the X direction (this can be visualized as a line pointing from the **reference node** to this node)
-   **y\_direction\_node**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Node number/name</span>; The node that defines the Y direction (this can be visualized as a line pointing from the **reference node** to this node)
-   **x\_offset**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>; The amount the prop should be moved in the X direction from the **reference node**. The distance it is moved depends on the distance between the **Reference node** and the '''X direction node '''(it's proportional): (0) leaves the prop on the reference node, (1) moves it all the way to the **X direction node**, and (0.5) puts the prop half-way between the two
-   **y\_offset**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>; The amount the prop should be moved in the Y direction from the **reference node**. Like the **X direction offset**, the amount it is proportional to the distance between the **reference node** and the **Y direction node**.
-   **z\_offset**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>; Imagine a surface which the X and Y directions pass straight through. If looking along that surface is the forwards direction, then this field moves the prop straight up. Unlike the **X direction offset** and the **Y direction offset**, the amount for the straight up offset is measured in meters
-   **x\_axis\_rotation**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>; The amount the prop should be rotated about the X axis
-   **y\_axis\_rotation**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>; The amount the prop should be rotated about the Y axis
-   **z\_axis\_rotation**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>; The amount the prop should be rotated about the 'straight up' axis
-   **mesh\_name\_or\_special\_prop**: <span style="color:#BD0058">String (may start with a keyword)</span>; The name of the Ogre3D mesh object used for the prop.
    If the mesh name starts with one of the following keywords, it will have special behavior:

-   -   <span style="color:#892500">"dashboard"</span>: A custom dashboard + steering wheel mesh. See below.
    -   <span style="color:#892500">"dashboard-rh"</span>: A custom dashboard +steering wheel mesh on right side. See below.
    -   <span style="color:#892500">"leftmirror"</span>: Left rear view mirror.
    -   <span style="color:#892500">"rightmirror"</span>: Right rear view mirror.
    -   <span style="color:#892500">"seat"</span>: Driver's seat: Positions the driver character and turns translucent if appropriate. Skins the prop using material `driversseat`.
        Note: if multiple "seat\[2\]" props are defined, the **first** one is the driver's seat.
    -   <span style="color:#892500">"seat2"</span>: Driver's seat: Same as "seat" except it doesn't force the `driversseat` material.
        Note: if multiple "seat\[2\]" props are defined, the **first** one is the driver's seat.
    -   <span style="color:#892500">"beacon"</span>: A beacon. Color and flare material are adjustable (default = orange)
    -   <span style="color:#892500">"redbeacon"</span>: A red beacon which flashes red. Fixed color and flare material.
    -   <span style="color:#892500">"lightbar"</span>: Police lightbar beacon, flashes red and blue (fixed). Also marks the vehicle as "police car" and sets up some special sounds and controls.
    -   <span style="color:#892500">"spinprop"</span>: Plane propeller.

Please note that if you want to stick wheel meshes on a wheel, the third node has to be taken from one of the outer segments.

```
props
;ref,  x,  y, offsetx, offsety, offsetz, rotx, roty, rotz, mesh
93, 95, 92,    0.50,    0.37,     0.0,   90,    0,    0, airintake.mesh
```

Note:

-   The **X offset** and the **Y offset** should logically between `0` and `1`, or if the body flexes too much the prop will not stick to the body correctly.
-   The coordinate system is actually really similar to 'normal coordinates', but it allows the angle between the two axes (ie. the angle between the **X node**, the **Reference node**, and the **Y node**) to be any value, not just `90` degrees. If that angle can be made to be `90` degrees, then the weird coordinate system will turn into 'normal coordinates'. This can be used to make prop placement easier.

**For 0.38.8 and later:**

You can set the cameramode in which the prop should be shown:

```
    ; -2 = all the time, -1 = external only, >=0  cinecam number
    prop_camera_mode -1
```

You can disable shadows of the last specified flexbody:

```
disable_flexbody_shadows
```

<span style="background-color:#fb7">\[ Version 0.35+ \]</span>

Disables shadow casting of the last prop to improve complex truck FPS.

```
disable_prop_shadow
```

COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Parameters \#9 "Z rotation" and \#10 "Mesh name" can be delimited by just space. Parser will emit a warning.

## Special Prop: Dashboard

## Special Prop: Beacon

Change the beacon's color and flare material <span style="background-color:#fb7">\[ Version 0.35+ \]</span>

If you want to use you own mesh as beacon it should be named beacon-&lt;somename&gt;.mesh, e.g. `beacon-blue.mesh`

The only difference between this and a standard beacon is the flarematerialname e.g. `tracks/redbeaconflare` which sets the color of the light, and the RGB value of the flash (The last three numbers), that sets the color of the light that is reflected from objects when the beacon lights them.

NOTE: All special parameters are required, otherwise none of them will take effect.

**Parameters:**

-   **reference\_node**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Node number/name</span>; Like ordinary prop

<!-- -->

-   **x\_direction\_node**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Node number/name</span>; Like ordinary prop

<!-- -->

-   **flare\_material\_name**: <span style="color:#BD0058">String</span>; Material to use for the flare

<!-- -->

-   **flare\_color\_red**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number (`0` - `1`)</span>; Intensity (`0` = full dark, `1` = full bright) . This color will be mixed with color of the flare texture. If the texture is white, all coloring is specified this way.

<!-- -->

-   **flare\_color\_green**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number (`0 - 1`)</span>; Intensity (`0` = full dark, `1` = full bright). This color will be mixed with color of the flare texture. If the texture is white, all coloring is specified this way.

<!-- -->

n3, 0, 0, 0
```

Add the **add\_animation** line **AFTER** the prop in your prop section that you want to animate:

add_animation 180, 0, 0, source: roll, mode:x-rotation
;virtual attitude indicator (artificial horizon)( look below for the GIMBAL LOCK issue!)
```

**Events**

```
add_animation 45, 0, 0, source: event, mode: x-rotation, event: TRUCK_TOGGLE_CONTACT
;Prop will rotate 45° x-axis when the starter key is pressed.
;There is only one event allowed with '''mode:event'''

add_animation 45, 0, 0, source:event, mode:x-rotation, eventlock, event:TRUCK_TOGGLE_CONTACT
add_animation 45, 0, 0, source:event, mode:x-rotation, event:TRUCK_STARTER
;This rotates the prop related to ignition status and additional 45° when the starter is pressed
;It is valid to stack up to 10 animations of any kind to one single prop.
```

**Autoanimation**

```
add_animation 0.005, 0, 0, source: permanent, mode: x-offset, autoanimate
;It will animate the related prop on the x-offset

add_animation -0.005, 0, 0, source: permanent, mode: x-offset, autoanimate
;Moving direction changed.

add_animation -0.005, 0, 0, source: permanent, mode: x-offset, autoanimate, noflip
;Will stop now at the limit and not flip anymore. So now it just moves one direction and thats it.

add_animation -0.005, 0, 0, source: permanent, mode: x-offset, autoanimate, noflip, bounce
;Will start moving left / right itself just according to the default limits

add_animation -0.005, -5, 20, source: permanent, mode: x-offset, autoanimate, noflip, bounce
;Will start moving left / right itself just according to the user custom limits.
;Keep in mind: for rotation and offset, first limits needs to be <=0  second >=0
;Limits are like prop offsets for offsets, default ( opt1=opt2=0) limit is +-10

add_animation -0.005, 15, 20, source: permanent, mode: x-offset, autoanimate, noflip, bounce
;The prop will jump instantly at start and bounce between that limits, which might be a bit confusing.

add_animation -0.005, 15, 20, source: permanent, mode: x-rotation, autoanimate
;Rotating instead of sliding. All the settings for offsets can be used with rotation too.
;Limits are in degree for rotations, default ( opt1=opt2=0) limit is +-180° ( a full circle)
```

**GIMBAL LOCK** To avoid axis corruption when rotating props: - Always place your prop with a y-rotation of `0` or `180°`. If you need to align your prop in another way, rotate the mesh in your mesh-editor! 

To avoid axis corruption when rotating multiple props: - Use only the x and y axis together, skip z. If you need 3 axis rotation, do the z-axis with a n/b-rotator as the base for your prop definition nodes. [Gimbal lock](http://wapedia.mobi/en/Gimbal_lock)

## Flexbodies

Flexbodies are pretty much the same as props. The only difference between them is that flexbodies deform.

You can declare several flexbodies. Each must be composed of the two lines (prop-like line and forset line).

## (sub-section) "Prop-like"

The first line of this section is exactly the same format as on the props section. Parameters:

-   **reference\_node**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Node number/name</span>; The base node, used to define the coordinate system.
-   **x\_direction\_node**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Node number/name</span>; The node that defines the X direction (this can be visualized as a line pointing from the **reference node** to this node)
-   **y\_direction\_node**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Node number/name</span>; The node that defines the Y direction (this can be visualized as a line pointing from the **reference node** to this node)
-   **x\_offset**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number <0 - 1></span>; The amount the prop should be moved in the X direction from the **reference\_node**.
-   **y\_offset**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number <0 - 1></span>; The amount the prop should be moved in the Y direction from the **reference\_node**.
-   **z\_offset\_meters**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>; Moves the flexbody "straight up". Unlike the **x\_offset** and the **y\_offset**, the distance is measured in meters.
-   **x\_axis\_rotation**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>; The amount the flexbody should be rotated about the X axis
-   **y\_axis\_rotation**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>; The amount the flexbody should be rotated about the Y axis
-   **z\_axis\_rotation**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>; The amount the flexbody should be rotated about the 'straight up' axis
-   **mesh\_name**: <span style="color:#BD0058">String</span>; The name of the Ogre3D mesh object used for the flexbody.

## (sub-directive) forset

As next, a line beginning with the word *forset* follows. Behind the word *forset*, you declare all nodes used for the deformation of the mesh (ranges are supported).

-   **node\_list**: <span style="color:#BD0058">List of node{number/name/range}</span>; List of nodes to use for deforming the flexbody. These nodes should be outer nodes of the vehicle, those that are close to the mesh.

Notes about backwards compatibility:

-   If you use a node range \[A-B\], RoR will tolerate if node B doesn't exist (warning will be emitted).
-   If you enter multiple commas `,,` between forset entries, parser will ignore it silently.
-   If there's a comma after last element, parser will ignore it silently.
-   Accepted separators between keyword "forset" and node ranges are: whitespace, comma `,`, colon `:`, or nothing at all (lines like `forset12,34,56` will be correctly evaluated as `forset 12, 34, 56`) for backwards compatibility.

## (sub-directive) disable\_flexbody\_shadow

<span style="color:#666">(optional)</span> <span style="background-color:#fb7">\[ Version 0.38.8+ \]</span>

No parameters. Disables shadow casting of the last flexbody to improve complex truck FPS.

## (sub-directive) flexbody\_camera\_mode

<span style="color:#666">(optional)</span> <span style="background-color:#fb7">\[ Version 0.38.8+ \]</span>

Sets the cameramode in which the flexbody should be shown:

-   **mode**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Decimal number</span> <span style="color:#0B8A00">default = `-2` (always visible)</span>; Flexbody visibility: `-2` = all the time (default), `-1` = external only, &gt;=`0` cinecam number

```
flexbodies
;ref,  x,  y, offsetx, offsety, offsetz, rotx, roty, rotz, mesh
3,  4, 19,       0,       0,   0.027,   90,    0,   90, dodgecharger.mesh
forset 0-16, 23-24, 31, 54-125

disable_flexbody_shadow

; -2 = all the time, -1 = external only, >=0  cinecam number
flexbody_camera_mode -1
```


Note: It's important to keep an eye on the number of vertices of your meshes. Not that there is a hard limit, but beyond `10000` vertices there could be a noticeable slowdown. As reference: the Dodge Charger mesh is about `4000` vertices.

## Submesh

Defines the most visible part of the truck: the body. It will dress the chassis with solid triangles. You must define each body panel (a continuous almost-flat section) in a different submesh section, in order to have sharp body angles, and to simplify texturing.

Most modern flexbodied trucks do not need a submesh section for visual purposes. However, the section is still required for collision to work.

A submesh has two subsections: the texcoords, that places nodes of the submesh on the texture image (coordinates between `0.0` and `1.0`) , and then the cab subsection, that draws the triangles, with triplets of node numbers.

### (sub-section) texcoords

-   **node**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Node number</span>; Node representing a vertex in the resulting geometry.
-   **u**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number 0.0 - 1.0</span>; The U texture coordinate: Position of this vertex on the X axis of the image.
-   **v**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number 0.0 - 1.0</span>; The V texture coordinate: Position of this vertex on the Y axis of the image.

### (sub-section) cab

-   **node\_1**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Node number</span>; Node representing a vertex 1 in the resulting geometry. Must be present in the <span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">texcoords</span> subsection.
-   **node\_2**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Node number</span>; Node representing a vertex 2 in the resulting geometry. Must be present in the <span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">texcoords</span> subsection.
-   **node\_2**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Node number</span>; Node representing a vertex 2 in the resulting geometry. Must be present in the <span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">texcoords</span> subsection.
-   **options** <span style="color:#666">(optional)</span>: <span style="color:#BD0058">String</span>
    -   `n`: Placeholder. Does nothing.
    -   `c`: This triangle will be a contact triangle that can contact with contacters nodes.
    -   `b`: This triangle will be part of a buoyant hull.
    -   `s`: <span style="background-color:#fb7">\[ Version 0.4+ \]</span> This triangle will be part of a buoyant hull, mouse dragging will be disabled.
    -   `r`: <span style="background-color:#fb7">\[ Version 0.4+ \]</span> This triangle will be part of a buoyant hull, mouse dragging only.
    -   `D`: (Combination of **b** and **c** flags) This triangle will be both a contact triangle AND a buoyant hull part.
    -   `p`: <span style="background-color:#fb7">\[ Version 0.36a - 0.4.7.0 \]</span> Makes the force required to pierce through the submesh triangle ten times bigger.
    -   `u`: <span style="background-color:#fb7">\[ Version 0.36a - 0.4.7.0 \]</span> Makes it impossible to pierce the submesh.
    -   `F`: <span style="background-color:#fb7">\[ Version 0.36a+ \]</span> Same as `p` but also a boat hull.
    -   `S`: <span style="background-color:#fb7">\[ Version 0.36a+ \]</span> Same as `u` but also a boat hull.

The order in which the three points forming the triangles is given is important, as its winding defines in which direction it will be visible. The winding must be counterclockwise to be visible.

The easiest way to create a submesh is to use [Blender 2.49b](https://forum.rigsofrods.org/downloads.php?do=file&id=180).

### (sub-directive) backmesh

No params. If added, the triangles' backsides will be black instead of see-through.

```
;cabin top

```

When making an invisible collision submesh for a flexbody vehicle, the "texcoords" section is not needed and should not be used.

```
;front bumper
submesh
cab
126,121,127,c
132,126,127,c
133,132,127,c
125,120,121,c
126,125,121,c
...
```

## set_collision_range

set\_collision\_range is `0.02` as default value, and defines the maximum range (`2` cm) around a truck's collision triangles that collisions start to happen. 

By increasing it, for example to `0.04`, penetrations become a lot more difficult.

```
set_collision_range 0.02
```

## submesh\_groundmodel

Specifies groundmodel should be used for the trucks contactive submeshes. It has module-wide effect; it only needs to be defined once per file.

Parameter:

-   **groundmodel\_name**: <span style="color:#BD0058">String</span>; <span style="color:#0B8A00">default = concrete</span>; The groundmodel to use. See also [Groundmodel Description File](https://archives.rigsofrods.org/wiki/index.php/Groundmodel_Description_File)

```
;submesh_groundmodel groundModelName
submesh_groundmodel rock
```

## Exhausts

This replaces the x or y node options. The **factor** parameter should be "1", because it is not used yet. The material should be "default" if no user-created one is made. (You could create your own particle emitter based on the default one: data/smoke.particle). Remember: The direction node is behind the ref node!

```
exhausts
;ref node, direction node, factor material
103,             99,      1 default
105,             98,      1 default
```

## Sections

This section allows you to have different options selectable from the vehicle spawner menu. Almost any section (`managedmaterials`, `engine`, `props`, `flexbodies`, etc) can be used with this. 

```
sectionconfig 0 lowspeed
sectionconfig 0 highspeed

section 0 lowspeed
engine
1000.000000, 1500.000000, 5000.000000, 2.000000, 10.850000, 9.520000, 6.560000, -1.000000
end_section

end_section
```

## Guisettings

By using this section you can set some parameters of the Truck GUI. This can be helpful if you're building a vehicle that has a relatively higher or lower speed than average.

Format: keyword <space> value

-   **dashboard**: <span style="background-color:#fb7">\[ Version 0.38.66+ \]</span> [Custom HUD layout](/vehicle-creation/making-custom-hud) that should be used for this truck. You can use multiple lines.

## Set\_skeleton\_settings

Inline-section; modifies the skeleton display (activated by pressing `K`) of the truck. Has module-wide effect; only needs to be issued once per file.

Parameters:

-   **visibility\_range\_in\_meters** <span style="color:#666">(nullable)</span>: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>; <span style="color:#0B8A00">default = 150</span>; <span style="color: #008079">Empty value = -1</span>

```
set_skeleton_settings 150, 0.01
```

2km sight range with `9` centimeter wide beams:

```
set_skeleton_settings 2000, 0.09
```

## Videocamera

The videocamera section describes how to set up multiple mirrors and extra cameras like a backup-camera for a truck or hook-camera for a crane. 

Both, cameras and mirrors, use the same technique, cameras just add a reflective calculation and flip (mirror) the image generated.

Parameters:

-   **reference\_node**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Node number/name</span>; The node where the camera is placed. This is your reference node. Any existing node\# is valid.
-   **left\_node**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Node number/name</span>; The Z-reference of the camera, should be exactly right of the reference node when the camera points forward to the trucks front. Any existing node\# is valid.
-   **bottom\_node**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Node number/name</span>; The Y-reference of the camera, should be exactly below the reference node when the camera points forward to the trucks front. Any existing node\# is valid.
-   **alt\_reference\_node** <span style="color:#666">(nullable)</span>: <span style="color:#BD0058">Node number/name</span>; <span style="color: #008079">Empty value = -1</span>; The alternative cam position node. It replaces the reference node for position but not for orientation. Good to setup mirrors and cams with just one extra node to an existing truck. Important for mirrors, read below! Any existing node\# is valid.
-   **alt\_orientation\_node** <span style="color:#666">(nullable)</span>: <span style="color:#BD0058">Node number/name</span>; <span style="color: #008079">Empty value = -1</span>; The alternative camera orientation node. If set, it skips any camera orientation calculation and makes the cam permanent look at the set node. Good for hooks moving up and down. Any existing node\# is valid.
-   **offset\_x** <span style="color:#666">(nullable)</span>: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>; <span style="color: #008079">Empty value = 0</span>; X-offset from reference or alternative cam position node. Works like props offsets, relates to the plane of Node 1-3 as frustum and moves the cam proportional forth and back on its roll-axis.
-   **offset\_y** <span style="color:#666">(nullable)</span>: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>; <span style="color: #008079">Empty value = 0</span>; Y-offset from reference or alternative cam position node. Works like props offsets, relates to the plane of Node 1-3 as frustum and moves the cam up and down in meters on its rotation-axis.
-   **offset\_z** <span style="color:#666">(nullable)</span>: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>; <span style="color: #008079">Empty value = 0</span>; Z-offset from reference or alternative cam position node. Works like props offsets, relates to the plane of Node 1-3 as frustum and moves the cam proportional left and right on its pitch-axis.
-   **rotation\_x** <span style="color:#666">(nullable)</span>: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>; <span style="color: #008079">Empty value = 0</span>; Optional camera X-rotation. Works like props rotation, relates to the plane of Node 1-3 as frustum. Adjust camera orientation without moving nodes.
-   **rotation\_y** <span style="color:#666">(nullable)</span>: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>; <span style="color: #008079">Empty value = 0</span>; Optional camera Y-rotation. Works like props rotation, relates to the plane of Node 1-3 as frustum. Adjust camera orientation without moving nodes. Avoid the gimbal lock, using Y-rotation is not recommended together with other axis.
-   **rotation\_z** <span style="color:#666">(nullable)</span>: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>; <span style="color: #008079">Empty value = 0</span>; Optional camera Z-rotation. Works like props rotation, relates to the plane of Node 1-3 as frustum. Adjust camera orientation without moving nodes.
-   **fov**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number, valid: 0.01 -179.9</span>; Camera field of view.
-   **texture\_width**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Positive decimal, must be power of 2</span>; X-resolution of the texture generated. Valid: any value^2 (POW) (see below for explanation), recommended maximum `256`, watch your FPS.
-   **texture\_height**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Positive decimal, must be power of 2</span>; Y-resolution of the texture generated. Valid: any value^2 (POW) (see below for explanation), recommended maximum `256`, watch your FPS.
-   **min\_clip\_distance**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>; Minimum distance in meters of objects to be rendered Valid: `0.1` - value&lt;maxclipdistance. Useful to blend out things that should not be displayed. Good to tune FPS.
-   **max\_clip\_distance**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span> Maximum distance in meters of objects to be rendered Valid: value&gt;minclipdistance - `32000`. Useful to blend out things that should not be displayed. Watch your FPS.
-   **camera\_role**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Decimal number</span>; Role aka function of the camera: `-1` == camera, `0` == tracker camera (requires an alternative camera orientation node), `1` == mirrors.
-   **camera\_mode**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Decimal number, use -2</span>; Camera switchoff state. Not supported yet, put a `-2` in here.
-   **material**: <span style="color:#BD0058">String</span>; The material the generated textured should be displayed on. Requires a prop (mesh) using this material to get any visual results.
-   **name**: <span style="background-color:#fb7">\[ Version 0.38.63+ \]</span> <span style="color:#BD0058">String</span>; Specify a name for this videocamera that might be used for the title of the renderwindow.

**Important**:

-   Videocameras only work with [props](#props).
-   Place the videocamera section **before loading any meshes** that should display the material
-   Its recommended that mirrors always use the alternative cam position node placed precise in the center of the mirror-mesh (the reflecting part) of the related mirror. Otherwise, reflective calculation might be wrong. Mirrors can use y-axis rotation presets for easy adjustment, to rotate x/z axis move the reference nodes accordingly to avoid gimbal lock, offset preset work too, but are not recommended to use.
-   Wrong or not existing materials might make RoR crash while parsing the truck. Be accurate !
-   `.material` file material definition is strictly necessary and needs to match the material in the truck-file line. Material definition features a fall-back texture when camera is not active or not set. Just add a texture unit with a texture definition, it will be replaced with the generated texture when camera is setup correct and active automatically.
-   Do **NOT** the set alternative camera orientation node to the same node\# then your reference node or ( if used ) the alternative cam position node. Makes no sense and might crash.
-   In 0.4.7.0, videocameras do not work with [skins](/vehicle-creation/alternate-skins). This has been fixed in the development builds.

Notes:

-   Any value `2^n` (POW) means that you have to choose a number out of the following numbers:

```
    2^0 = 1
    2^1 = 2
    2^2 = 4
    2^3 = 8
    2^4 = 16
    2^5 = 32
    2^6 = 64
    2^7 = 128
    2^8 = 256
    2^9 = 512
    2^10 = 1024
    2^11 = 2048
    2^12 = 4096
    2^13 = 8192
```

## Extcamera

The extcamera command allows you to change the 3rd person camera behavior.

Currently, there are three modes you can use:

The classic mode (also default if you do not use this command)

```
extcamera classic
```

The cinecam mode: it will rotate the camera around the cinecamera

```
extcamera cinecam
```

The node mode: it will rotate the camera around a specified node

```
;extcamera node <nodeid>
;for example:
extcamera node 123
```

The final two modes are useful for a vehicle with detaching parts, so the camera is fixed in the view of the main vehicle.

## Camerarail

In RoR 0.39.7 and above you can add a camerarail section to your beam objects. The camerarail generates a cSpline on base of the given nodes, on which you can move a camera. A new camera mode will be added ingame which is accessible with the "c"-button.

Camera controls:

-   Right-click: Rotate camera
-   Right-click + `CTRL` (left) + move mouse left/right: Move camera on spline. Speed up with `Shift` or slow down with `Alt`.
-   `CTRL` (left) + `Shift`+ `Space`: Enable/disable auto-tracking

Syntax:

```
camerarail
<node1>
[node2]
...
[node50]
```

You can define up to `50` nodes per beam object. You can use one node several times. If the first node is the same as the last one, the spline will be closed and the camera can move on the rail continuously. Example:

```
camerarail
5
6
7
8
5
```

If multiple beam objects, each with a `camerarail` section, are connected with hooks, the game will try to connect the splines. 

This way you can move the camera over multiple hooked vehicles without the need to switch the vehicle:

Object A (active) - Object B (hooked) - Object C (hooked)

The distance between the last camerarail node of one and the first camerarail node of another object needs to be under 5 meters.

# Sounds

Since version 0.36, vehicles can have custom sounds. By default, RoR uses a set of default sounds for your vehicle, but with the following sections you can customize these sounds.

## disabledefaultsounds

Use this simple statement to disable all sounds that RoR automatically adds to your vehicle. This allows you to start from a clean slate, and add your custom sounds without interference from the automatically added sounds. Example :

```
disabledefaultsounds
```

## Soundsources

Adds a sound source to your vehicle.

Parameters:

-   **node**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Node number</span>; The place where your sound will come from. Doesn't support named nodes.
-   **sound\_script\_name**: <span style="color:#BD0058">String</span>; Sound scripts are defined in [soundscript files](/vehicle-creation/fileformat-soundscript/). You can use game-defined sound scripts or your own sound scripts.

```
soundsources
;nodeID, sound
23, my_diesel
23, my_turbo
135, tracks/default_horn
```

## Soundsources2

Parameters:

-   **node**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Node number</span>; The place where your sound will come from. Doesn't support named nodes.
-   **mode**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Decimal number</span>
    -   **-2**: Global; enabled all the time
    -   **-1**: Enabled in external camera only
    -   **0 (or higher)**: Enabled for cinecamera number specified.
        Note: for backwards compatibility, the parser will read invalid values as `0` and emit a warning.
-   **sound\_script\_name**: <span style="color:#BD0058">String</span>; Sound scripts are defined in [soundscript files](/vehicle-creation/fileformat-soundscript). You can use game-defined sound scripts or your own sound scripts.

```

**Special wing formats to reduce node/beam count and CPU load:**

**(Use at own risk!)**

All examples lines refer to the node notation sample picture above.

'A' means Node A from that schematic diagram.
	 
	 
They work, no idea if they produce more or less lift then a wing with defined thickness.

Only use them for invisible wings with meshed props/flexbodies for the visual appearance and with a transparent material, skinning them results in an ugly visual appearance.

-   Flarewing using 2 nodes

For precise aviation flare placement you can use a wing defined with only 2 nodes. It has no aerodynamic influence at all It has an extremely low node/beam count -- Vital: Needs to be placed as first wing in the wings section. Use `NACA0009.afl` as the airfoil.

```
wings
A,B,A,B,A,B,A,B,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,n,0,0,0, NACA0009.afl
```

-   Trim or main wing using 3 nodes

-- Defines a wing using only 3 nodes. Placing this wing first in the wing section results in the aviation flares appearing on the nodes `A,B` ( red/green ) and `E` (white flash).

Works horizontally and vertically. (As on the tail.) Low node/beam count wing for self built flaps, ailerons, elevators or trimwings, very easy to animate with a single [hydro](#hydros). 

Can be used with any active control surface and any afl-format 

**Known Issues: Sometimes vertical tailfin wings work only one direction. If RoR crashes exchange node `A` and `B` with each other.**

```
wings
A,B,A,B,E,E,E,E,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,n,0,0,0, NACA0009.afl
```

-   Trim or main wing using 4 nodes

-- Defines a wing using only 4 nodes. Placed first in the wing section results in the aviation flares appearing on the nodes `A,B` (red/green) and `E,F` (white flash) 

Works horizontally and vertically (As on the tail.) 

Low node/beam count wing for main wings 

Can be used with any active control surface and any afl-format. 

**Known Issues: sometimes vertical tailfin wings work only one direction. If RoR crashes exchange node `A,B` and `E,F` with each other**

```
wings
A,B,A,B,E,F,E,F,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,n,0,0,0, NACA0009.afl
```

## Airbrakes

Airbrakes are a moving panel used to slow down an airplane (key bindings: `3` and `4`). They are positioned similarly to [props](#props). 

These airbrakes can be easily added to a wing box, with `noderef`, `nodex`, `nodey` and nodea being the four upper nodes of a box.

Parameters:

-   **reference\_node**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Node number/name</span>; The base node, used to define the coordinate system
-   **x\_direction\_node**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Node number/name</span>; The node that defines the X direction (this can be visualized as a line pointing from the **reference node** to this node)
-   **y\_direction\_node**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Node number/name</span>; The node that defines the Y direction (this can be visualized as a line pointing from the **reference node** to this node)
-   **additional\_node**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Node number/name</span>; An additional node to make the braking forces symmetric (they are applied to `noderef`, `nodex`, `nodey` and `nodea`).
-   **x\_offset**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number <0 - 1></span>; The amount the prop should be moved in the X direction from the **reference node**. The distance it is moved depends on the distance between the **Reference node** and the '''X direction node '''(it's proportional): (0) leaves the prop on the reference node, (1) moves it all the way to the **X direction node**, and (0.5) puts the prop half-way between the two
-   **y\_offset**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number <0 - 1></span>; The amount the prop should be moved in the Y direction from the **reference node**. Like the **X direction offset**, the amount it is proportional to the distance between the **reference node** and the **Y direction node**.
-   **z\_offset**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number <0 - 1></span>; Imagine a surface which the X and Y directions pass straight through. If looking along that surface is the forwards direction, then this field moves the prop straight up. Unlike the **X direction offset** and the **Y direction offset**, the amount for the straight up offset is measured in meters
-   **width**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>; Dimension of the panel
-   **height**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>; Dimension of the panel
-   **max\_inclination\_angle**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>; Maximum inclination angle
-   **texcoord\_x1**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number <0 - 1></span>; Texture coordinate.
-   **texcoord\_y1**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number <0 - 1></span>; Texture coordinate.
-   **texcoord\_x2**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number <0 - 1></span>; Texture coordinate.
-   **texcoord\_y2**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number <0 - 1></span>; Texture coordinate.
-   **lift\_coefficient** <span style="color:#666">(optional)</span>: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>; <span style="color:#0B8A00">default = -1.0</span>

```

```

## Turboprops

The turboprops section defines the turboprop engines, and makes the truck a plane!

It is important that this section comes AFTER the [props](#props) section, because you will need to add a `spinprop.mesh` entry to the props before turboprops will work. 

One `pale.mesh` per propeller blade can also be added for visible blades. Easy, eh? Each prop blade is associated to a blade tip node, and you must ensure the blade nodes are correctly interconnected with beams so it will spin freely around its axis, while maintaining a rigid prop disc. 

See how the [Antonov 12](https://forum.rigsofrods.org/downloads.php?do=file&id=313) is made. You can also make 2 or 3 blade props by putting a `-1` instead of the blade tip node number(see the [Twin Otter](https://forum.rigsofrods.org/downloads.php?do=file&id=323) for example). Parameters are:

-   **reference\_node**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Node number/name</span>; Center of the prop
-   **axis\_node**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Node number/name</span>; Back of the prop
-   **blade\_1\_tip\_node**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Node number/name</span>;
-   **blade\_2\_tip\_node**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Node number/name</span>;
-   **blade\_3\_tip\_node**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Node number/name</span>;
-   **blade\_4\_tip\_node**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Node number/name</span>;
-   **turbine\_power**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>; Power of the turbine (in kW)
-   **airfoil**: <span style="color:#BD0058">String</span>; Airfoil of the blades

## Fusedrag

The fusedrag section helps the correct modeling of the fuselage contribution to the aerodynamic drag of a plane. 

It also makes possible the "masking" of the aerodynamic contribution of an object loaded inside the plane. 

It models the fuselage as a big wing section, with an airfoil (usually a symmetrical airfoil like `NACA0009`). Fusedrag can also be used in road vehicles to aid top speed. The parameters are:

-   **Number of the front-most node of the fuselage**
-   **Number of the rear-most node of the fuselage**
-   **Approximate width of the fuselage**
-   **Airfoil name**

```
fusedrag
131, 51, 4.0, NACA0009.afl
```

-   **autocalc** Automatically calculates the width and height of the truck.
-   **Fusedrag area coefficient** This is optional, default = "1.0" ( = 100% ) Smaller values will make your truck go faster.
-   **Airfoil name** This is optional, default = `NACA0009.afl`

```
fusedrag
// fusedrag calculated by truck width and height using NACA0009.afl airfoil
131, 51, autocalc

// fusedrag calculated by truck width and height using NACA0009.afl airfoil with coef 0.5
131, 51, autocalc, 0.5

// fusedrag calculated by truck width and height using airfoil_name.afl airfoil with coef 1.75

```

## Turbojets

Defines a turbojet. Parameters:

-   **front\_node**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Node number/name</span>; A node at the air intake.
-   **back\_node**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Node number/name</span>; A node at the base of the nozzle.
-   **side\_node**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Node number/name</span>; A node at the side of the engine, for reference.
-   **is\_reversable**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Integer (yes/no)</span>; Boolean meaning: `0` is NO, anything else (including `-1`) is YES
-   **dry\_thrust**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>; The thrust without afterburner (in kilonewtons).
-   **wet\_thrust**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>; The total thrust with afterburner, or zero if it does not apply.
-   **front\_diameter**: <span style="color:#BD0058">`0`</span>; Unused.
-   **back\_diameter**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>; The nozzle diameter.
-   **nozzle\_length**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>; The length of the nozzle. This will automatically add a nozzle prop at the end of the engine, with the diameter and length specified.

## Pistonprops

Pistonprops act in almost the exact same way as turboprops minus two differences. The pitch is manually set and stays at a set value and it has a couplenode.

Parameters:

-   **reference\_node**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Node number/name</span>; Center of the prop
-   **axis\_node**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Node number/name</span>; Back of the prop
-   **blade\_1\_tip\_node**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Node number/name</span>;
-   **blade\_2\_tip\_node**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Node number/name</span>;
-   **blade\_3\_tip\_node**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Node number/name</span>;
-   **blade\_4\_tip\_node**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Node number/name</span>;
-   **couple\_node**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Node number/name OR -1</span>; It is unknown of what the couplenode does so it's recommended to leave it at `-1`.
-   **turbine\_power**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>; Power of the turbine (in kW)
-   **pitch**: <span style="color:#BD0058">Real number</span>;
-   **airfoil**: <span style="color:#BD0058">String</span>; Airfoil of the blades

# Boats

See: [Boats](/vehicle-creation/boats)

## Screwprops

Screwprops are boats' propellers. Currently, steering is only done by thrust vectoring. 

The current syntax is `prop node`, `back node`, `top node`, `power`.

```
screwprops
;prop node, back node, top node,    power
        88,        93,       91, 100000.0
        89,        92,       90, 100000.0
```
