============

## Installation 

### Downloading

To get started, download the latest version of the game from our [homepage](https://www.rigsofrods.org/).

From here, choose which package you would like to install. We recommend the Installer for beginner users.

You will be redirected to Sourceforge, and the file will automatically download. Once downloaded, double-click the file to start the installer.

**If you're running Linux, you can download the game by following [these instructions](https://forum.rigsofrods.org/threads/test-build-version-0-4-8-rc4.1217/).**

### Windows SmartScreen warning

When launching the installer for the first time, Windows Defender SmartScreen may prevent the installer from starting. 

If this happens, click `More info` then `Run anyway`.

The installer should launch once you accept the UAC dialog.

If you wish to install RoR to another location, you can change it here. We recommend leaving it to the default location.

By default, RoR only comes with a very small selection of content. To help new players, we've created content packs which provide a good selection of vehicles and terrains to get you started.

You can choose to either download all the packs, or only select the ones that interest you. For simplicity's sake, no packs will be downloaded.

Click `Next` to continue.
