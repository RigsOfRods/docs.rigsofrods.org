# Repository Submission Guidelines

To ensure consistency and quality, please follow these guidelines when creating and submitting to the repository.

## General Requirements

1. Any content you submit must be your own creation, or [you must have permission](community-guidelines.md#dont-steal-content-or-violate-intellectual-property) from the original creator(s) to share or modify their work.
2. You must ensure that the content you submit is compatible with the latest stable version of Rigs of Rods. Please test your mod to ensure it works correctly before submission.
3. Ensure filenames and asset names are descriptive and unique to avoid conflicts with other mods.
4. Any content you submit must not exceed 4GB in size. This limit is imposed to prevent abuse and helps us to save on valuable bandwidth.
5. Content submitted to the Rigs of Rods repository must be available free of charge to the community. Selling mods or offering paid versions within the official repository is strictly prohibited. While mods must be free, you can accept donations to support your work. Feel free to include a link to your donation page (e.g., PayPal, Patreon, Ko-fi) in your modâ€™s README or repository description.

## Licensing

When submitting, you must clearly specify the license under which your work is being distributed. This ensures transparency regarding how others can use, modify, and redistribute your work. You are not required to do this, as your work is protected regardless.[^1]

We recommend using a well-known open-source license to make your intentions clear:

- GNU General Public License (GPL): Requires derivatives of your work to be distributed under the same license.[^2]
- MIT License: Allows users to do almost anything with your work, including commercial use, as long as they include your original copyright notice.[^3]
- Creative Commons License (CC): A flexible licensing option, which allows you to control commercial use, derivatives, and attribution requirements.

If you choose to license your work, include a `LICENSE` file in the root of your mod folder. If you're using assets from other creators, be sure to comply with their license terms and credit them appropriately.

[^1]: While we highly encourage modders to include a license for clarity, it is not strictly required. However, mods without a license may cause ambiguity regarding usage rights, modifications, and redistribution by others.

## Approval Flow

!!! warning "Expect a delay in the approval process"

    The approval process is managed by repository maintainers, who are volunteers and can only dedicate so much of their time
    to testing and approving repository submissions. You can expect to wait a couple days to a couple of weeks depending who is
    available and how thorough the maintainer is.

    A repository maintainer may reach out to you directly if they detect an issue with your submission. The quicker you reply, the quicker your submission is approved.

- Once you've completed your submission, it will remain visible only to you and the staff. This means that between the time of submission and until a maintainer reviews it, you can still make changes, such as modifying the description or swapping out files.
- When a maintainer tests your submission, several factors are considered, including functionality and performance, compatibility, potential bugs and issues, and adherence to the General Requirements.
- If feedback is needed, the maintainer will reach out to you directly so you can address it.
- The decision to grant final approval is at the discretion of the maintainer. This can not be disputed.
