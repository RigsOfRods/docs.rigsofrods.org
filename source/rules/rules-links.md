## Do not advertise

No advertisements of any kind are permitted without prior approval from a forum administrator. Please send a PM to a forum admin if you wish to post a link to another site or otherwise advertise something.

Also unpaid advertisement for non-free vehicles (or any other RoR-related business) is forbidden in the forums! All content for RoR is free. Anyone found to be selling mods will be banned.

Moderators and admins are allowed to remove any external link that is inappropriate with the rules or the goal of the forum.

## Spam 

Spam is strictly forbidden! Our forum has spam protection that keeps most spammers out. If you find a spam post, just use the Report button and let a staff member handle it. Do not reply to the spammer.
