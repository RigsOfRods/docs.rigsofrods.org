This page exists as a clarification for the following rule:

[Terms of Service#UNWRITTEN](/rules/terms-of-service/#unwritten)

# Not All-Inclusive

This rules list does not try to list every single bad behaviour, as many behaviours are common sense. It will generally list common guidelines that are often disregarded.

# Cleverness

Please do not try to cleverly circumvent some rule listed here. These rules are general guidelines and are very flexible.

# Rules Lawyering

The rules exist to make the forum a better place. Sometimes there will be exceptions.

Also, the rules list is kept a short as possible on purpose. You may see some apparent loophole, but the spirit of the rules is enforced - so you will find yourself in trouble if you try to exploit some loophole.

# Mods and Admins

If a moderator or admin tells you to do something, do it. If you have a problem with it, you may start a thread on the [forum support board](https://forum.rigsofrods.org/forums/webservices-support.9/)
or send the staff member a PM.
