This page exists as a clarification for the following rule:

[Terms of Service#SEARCH](/rules/terms-of-service/#search)

# Search before asking

Search the forum before making a request or asking a question. Many times, you will find that your question or problem has already been posted, and there is an answer sitting right there, waiting for you to find - without the delay of waiting for someone to reply.

Adding your vote to an existing request or problem report is better than creating a new topic.

# Why was I warned?

If you've been given a warning pointing you here, it's possible that you have asked a question that is considered to be very lazy. 

For example, if someone asks, "What does a Toyota truck look like?", I would warn them regarding this guideline, because you can very easily use [Google image search](https://images.google.com/) to find plenty of pictures of Toyota trucks.
