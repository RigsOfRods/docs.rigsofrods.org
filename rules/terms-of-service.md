# INFRACTIONS

If you disregard any of the following rules, you will get a warning or infraction.

# AGE REQUIREMENT 

To use any of our online services, the minimum age requirement is 13 years of age. If you are below the age of 13, you are not allowed to use any of our web services (Reason: [COPPA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_Online_Privacy_Protection_Act))

# [UNWRITTEN](/rules/rules-unwritten)

This list of rules is not all-inclusive. Just because something's not here doesn't mean it's not wrong. Do not be a rules lawyer.
 
# [STOLEN CONTENT](/rules/rules-stolen-content)

Do not steal content from other people and claim it as yours. Do not use content from Sketchup Warehouse or other games. 
Do not use copyrighted content without written permission of the original authors. 
Do not show pictures or videos of stolen content.

# INSULTING

Don't insult other members. Do not tell members to kill themselves or things in that category, there will be hard consequences.

# [NICE](/rules/rules-nice)

Don't be an idiot. Moderators are given a little leeway when dealing with rules breakers, especially repeat offenders. Do NOT backtalk moderators or administrators. EVER.

# [BACKSEAT](/rules/rules-backseat)

Do not backseat moderate. If you see something wrong, chances are a moderator will get to it soon. If it's a minor problem, ignore it. If it's a major problem, use the Report button below a post. Do not start or contribute to a flamewar.

# [BEGGING](/rules/rules-begging)

Do not beg, whine, or pester. Don't ask for or when anything will be released. Don't ask for updates. Don't ask for betas.

# [USELESS](/rules/rules-useless)

Do not bump topics. Do not use memes. Don't reply just to reply - write something useful.

# [SEARCH](/rules/rules-search)

Search before asking questions, especially questions about mod links. Most of the time you can just Google the name of the mod and it'll be on the first result.

# [GRAMMAR](/rules/rules-grammar)

Don't use Discord/IRC/chat speak. Use proper spelling, punctuation, and grammar. Don't TYPE IN ALL CAPS! Don't spam with emoticons.

# [SINGULARITY](/rules/rules-singularity)

**One account per person. One person per account.** One topic per subject. One post per problem. Any particular thing should appear just once - don't waste resources.

# PROFANITY

No profanity. Do not try to get around the censored words filter by selectively misspelling a word (e.g. replacing letter 's' with dollar signs) 

# [LINKS](/rules/rules-links)

No external links for anything bad (viruses, porn, warez) or anything requiring money (donation sites, software, services).
 
# PRIVACY

Do not post your email. Do not post public details such as your address or real name unless you are considered an adult in the country you reside.
 
# LANGUAGE

Use the language of the board - this is English. You may use multiple languages that all say the same thing as long as one of them is the board's language.
 
# EMBEDDING IMAGES

The preferred method for adding images to posts is to click the ![attach-files](/images/forum-attachment-button.png) button below the typing area of a post, and attaching images there. Pictures are automatically uploaded when you submit your post. You may edit pictures later if needed.

In huge screenshot threads ([Random Screens](https://forum.rigsofrods.org/threads/random-screens.738/), [Development Screens](https://forum.rigsofrods.org/threads/development-screens.1/)) it is obligatory to use the internal attachment system of the forum to improve performance.
 
Please do not use services like imageshack to show images as the images are getting deleted over there after a certain time! Please note this does not apply to signatures.

# RULES CHANGES
The written guidelines will change with time. Things will be added and updated. But it is not to be expected that all bad behaviours will appear here. You are expected to try your best not to break any guidelines, and to be a positive contributor, rather than a problem contributor.
