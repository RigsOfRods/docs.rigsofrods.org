# Introduction

> L3DT is a Windows application for generating terrain maps and textures. 
> It is intended to help game developers and digital artists create vast high-quality 3D worlds. 

>[About L3DT web page](http://www.bundysoft.com/docs/doku.php?id=l3dt:about)

This page will teach you how to export an L3DT terrain into Rigs of Rods version 0.4.8.0+.

**Please read everything carefully and do not skip any steps.**

# Required applications

- [L3DT (Standard or Professional)](http://www.bundysoft.com/L3DT/) ([Pro 16.05](http://www.bundysoft.com/L3DT/downloads/pro-trial.php) will be used here)
- [GIMP 2.10](https://www.gimp.org/downloads/)
- [DDS plugin for GIMP](https://code.google.com/archive/p/gimp-dds/downloads) (This page will not show you how to install it, ask Google)
- [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
- A brain, some basic computer knowledge, and some patience

For this tutorial, I will assume you already have a ready-to-export terrain in L3DT.

![1](/images/L3DT-1.png)
![2](/images/L3DT-2.png)

This is a simple 1024x1024 terrain generated by L3DT's "Design Map" feature.

I've uploaded the project files [here](/download/L3DT_Tutorial_Terrain_ProjectFile.zip) for reference. 

**Note**: You may only be able to open the project file in the Pro version due to it using 4096x4096 textures.

# Setting up   

Start by downloading a [template terrain](https://forum.rigsofrods.org/resources/template-raw-png-terrains.262/). For simplicity sake, choose the `template_04_raw.zip` version. 

Once downloaded, extract the zip into any folder.

![3](/images/L3DT-explorer1.png)

Delete `template_04_raw.raw`, `simple2_asphalt_diffusespecular.dds`, and `simple2_asphalt_normalheight.dds` as you will not be needing them.

![4](/images/L3DT-explorer2.png)

Rename the files to what you'd like your terrain to be named (for this tutorial I will just name it `l3dt_tutorial`).

![5](/images/L3DT-explorer3.png)

Now open all the files in Notepad++ by selecting them then right click -> `Edit with Notepad++`

![6](/images/L3DT-explorer4.png)

![7](/images/L3DT-notepadplusplus1.png)

Press `CTRL+F` to open the Find menu, then switch to the `Replace` tab.

Set "Find what" to `template_04_raw` and "Replace with" with your terrain name, then click `Replace All in All Opened Documents`.

If successful, you should see something similar to `Replace in Opened Files: 5 occurrences were replaced.`

![8](/images/L3DT-notepadplusplus2.png)

Now click `File` -> `Save All` to save your current files.

We're ready to export the heightmap now.

# Exporting the heightmap

In L3DT, right click the `Heightfield` layer -> `Export layer...`

![9](/images/L3DT-heightmap-export1.png)

Set the "File format" to `RAW`.

Click the `...` button to browse to where your terrain files are located. Name the file the same as you did previously (i.e. `l3dt_tutorial.raw`).

Now check the `Re-size for export` box and set the Width and Height to the same values as you did when you generated the terrain (i.e. 1024x1024).

![10](/images/L3DT-heightmap-export2.png)

You should now have a `.raw` file in your working directory.

![11](/images/L3DT-explorer5.png)

## The OTC file

Now go back to Notepad++ and open `l3dt_tutorial.otc`. The file will look similar to this:

```
Heightmap.0.0.raw.size=5
Heightmap.0.0.raw.bpp=2
Heightmap.0.0.flipX=0

WorldSizeX=3000
WorldSizeZ=3000
WorldSizeY=0

 
disableCaching=1
 
PageFileFormat=l3dt_tutorial-page-0-0.otc

MaxPixelError=0
LightmapEnabled=0
SpecularMappingEnabled=1
NormalMappingEnabled=1
```

`Heightmap.0.0.raw.size=5`

Size of your heightmap. For this terrain, it is `1024`.

`Heightmap.0.0.raw.bpp=2`

Bytes per pixel (1 = 8bit, 2=16bit). Leave this at `2`.
 
`Heightmap.0.0.flipX=0`

If the terrain heightmap needs to be flipped. since L3DT doesn't export the heightmap upside down leave this at `0`.

`WorldSizeX=3000`

`WorldSizeZ=3000`

Size of the terrain. Since this is a 1024x1024 terrain, set both to `1024`.

`WorldSizeY=0`

Maximum height of the terrain. To get this value, in L3DT go to `Operations` -> `Heightfield` -> `Change vertical range...`.

![12](/images/L3DT-heightmap-height1.png)

![13](/images/L3DT-heightmap-height2.png)

Add the **non-negative** minimum value to the maximum value. 

![14](/images/L3DT-heightmap-height3.png)

If you get a decimal, you should be safe to round it (i.e. `139`).

`disableCaching=1`

This prevents the game from caching the heightmap. For testing purposes, leave it at `1`.

`PageFileFormat=l3dt_tutorial-page-0-0.otc`

Name of the file that defines the terrain textures. Since we already renamed it earlier, there's no need to change this.

```
MaxPixelError=0
LightmapEnabled=0
SpecularMappingEnabled=1
NormalMappingEnabled=1
```

Advanced heightmap/texture settings, it's best to leave these at their current values.

The finished file:

```
Heightmap.0.0.raw.size=1024
Heightmap.0.0.raw.bpp=2
Heightmap.0.0.flipX=0

WorldSizeX=1024
WorldSizeZ=1024
WorldSizeY=139

 
disableCaching=1
 
PageFileFormat=l3dt_tutorial-page-0-0.otc

MaxPixelError=0
LightmapEnabled=0
SpecularMappingEnabled=1
NormalMappingEnabled=1
```

We're ready to export the textures now. 

# Exporting textures

## Texture map

Right click `Texture map` -> `Export layer...`

![15](/images/L3DT-texture-export1.png)

Set the "File format" to `PNG`.

Just as you did previously, browse to your terrain directory and set the file name (i.e. `l3dt_tutorial.png`).

Check the `Re-size for export` box and set your texture size (in this case, `4096x4096`)

![16](/images/L3DT-texture-export2.png)

## Normal map

Now right click `Terrain normals` -> `Export layer...` and repeat the same steps as last time.

![17](/images/L3DT-texture-export3.png)

You should now have two textures in your working directory.

![18](/images/L3DT-explorer6.png)

## Applying alpha mask

To prevent the terrain texture from being overly shiny in-game, you will have to apply an alpha mask to both the texture map and the normal map.
To do this, open both textures in GIMP.

![19](/images/L3DT-gimp1.png)

Go to `Layer` -> `Mask` -> `Add Layer Mask...`

![20](/images/L3DT-gimp2.png)

Select `Black (full transparency)` then click `Add`.

![21](/images/L3DT-gimp3.png)

![22](/images/L3DT-gimp3.1.png)

Now go to `File` -> `Export As...`

![23](/images/L3DT-gimp4.png)

Change the file extension to `.dds` then click `Export`.

![24](/images/L3DT-gimp5.png)

If you installed the DDS plugin correctly, you should now have a `Save as DDS` dialog.

Set the `Compression` to `BC3 / DXT5` then click `OK` to export.

![25](/images/L3DT-gimp6.png)

Repeat the same steps for the normal map texture. 

Once you're done, you should have two new DDS files in your working directory.

![26](/images/L3DT-explorer7.png)

You can now delete the two PNG textures we exported earlier as they're no longer needed.

![27](/images/L3DT-explorer8.png)

## The page file

Now open `l3dt_tutorial-page-0-0.otc`. The file will look similar to this:

```
l3dt_tutorial.raw
1
; worldSize, diffusespecular, normalheight, blendmap, blendmapmode, alpha
4, simple2_asphalt_diffusespecular.dds, simple2_asphalt_diffusespecular.dds
```

`l3dt_tutorial.raw`

The name of your heightmap RAW file. Since we already renamed it earlier, there's no need to change this.

`1`

The number of texture layers. Since we only have 1 layer, leave it at `1`.

`4, simple2_asphalt_diffusespecular.dds, simple2_asphalt_diffusespecular.dds`

`4` 

The size of your terrain. It typically is the same as the `WorldSizeX/WorldSizeZ` values. So in this case, `1024`.

`simple2_asphalt_diffusespecular.dds, simple2_asphalt_diffusespecular.dds` 

The names of your texture map and normal map. For this terrain, they are named `l3dt_tutorial.dds` and `l3dt_tutorial_normal.dds`.

The finished file:

```
l3dt_tutorial.raw
1
; worldSize, diffusespecular, normalheight, blendmap, blendmapmode, alpha
1024, l3dt_tutorial.dds, l3dt_tutorial_normal.dds
```


## The Terrn2 file

The last file we need to edit is the `l3dt_tutorial.terrn2` file. It will look similar to this:

```
[General]
Name = Template 0.4 (RAW Heightmap) Terrain
GeometryConfig = l3dt_tutorial.otc
Water=0
#WaterLine=1.0
AmbientColor = 0.93, 0.86, 0.76
StartPosition = 512, 1, 512
#CaelumConfigFile =
SandStormCubeMap = tracks/skyboxcol
Gravity = -9.81
CategoryID = 129
Version = 1
GUID = 995a989c-28a7-4836-b5fe-bc699b81b97b
//TractionMap = l3dt_tutorial-landuse.cfg


[Authors]
template = CuriousMike

 
[Objects]
l3dt_tutorial.tobj=

[Scripts]
```

`Name = Template 0.4 (RAW Heightmap) Terrain`

The name of your terrain. In this example, I will name it `L3DT Tutorial Terrain V2`.

`GeometryConfig = l3dt_tutorial.otc`

The filename of your terrain's main OTC file. Since we already renamed it earlier, there's no need to change this.

`Water=0`

If your map has water, set this to `1`. Otherwise, leave it at `0`.

`#WaterLine=1.0`

If your terrain doesn't have water, skip this step. Otherwise, remove the `#` from the beginning of the line. 

To get this value, go back to the `Change vertical range...` dialog you got the minimum/maximum height values from earlier.

![28](/images/L3DT-heightmap-height2.png)

The **non-negative** minimum value is your `WaterLine` value. For this terrain, it is `40`. 

Again, you should be safe to round it.

```
AmbientColor = 0.93, 0.86, 0.76
StartPosition = 512, 1, 512
#CaelumConfigFile =
SandStormCubeMap = tracks/skyboxcol
Gravity = -9.81
CategoryID = 129
Version = 1
```

These values can currently be left as is. 

`GUID = 995a989c-28a7-4836-b5fe-bc699b81b97b`

The ID that uniquely identifies your terrain. You can generate one [here](https://www.guidgenerator.com/online-guid-generator.aspx).

`//TractionMap = l3dt_tutorial-landuse.cfg`

The file that defines the different ground types. Since we don't currently have one, leave it commented out.

```
[Authors]
template = CuriousMike
```

The authors of the terrain. Just set your username. For example `terrain = CuriousMike`.

```
[Objects]
l3dt_tutorial.tobj=
```

The name of your objects file. Since we already renamed it earlier, there's no need to change this.

`[Scripts]`

The AngelScript filename. Since we don't have one, just ignore this. 

# In-Game

And finally, zip all your files up and place them into your `packs`/`mods` folder.

Now launch RoR and load your terrain!

If everything went well, your terrain should look almost indentical to how it does in L3DT's Sapphire:

![29](/images/L3DT-ingame1.png)

![29.1](/images/L3DT-ingamecompare.png)

# Changing the spawn position

When you loaded the terrain, you most likely spawned in the water or on the side of a mountain. 

To fix this, move RoRBot to where you'd like to spawn at.

![30](/images/L3DT-ingame2.png)

Then press the `h` key. This is will log the current position to `RoR.log`.

Now browse to `C:\Users\%username%\Documents\Rigs of Rods 0.4\logs` and open the `RoR.log` file.

![31](/images/L3DT-logfile.png)

Scroll to the bottom of the file. You should find a line similar to this:

`22:21:51: Position:  885.289,  113.769,  586.640,    0.0,    0.0,    0.0`

Now open your `.terrn2` file and find the `StartPosition` line.

`StartPosition = 512, 1, 512`

Copy the first 3 numbers from the position line, for example:

`StartPosition = 885.289,  113.769,  586.640`

Save the file and launch RoR. You should now spawn in the position you set. 

Congratulations! You have learned how to get your L3DT terrain in-game!

# Troubleshooting

## Stream size does not match calculated image size

**Q**:`Ogre::InvalidParametersException::InvalidParametersException: Stream size does not match calculated image size`

**A**: Your `Heightmap.0.0.raw.size` value does not match the size of your exported raw file. Make sure the size you set in the export dialog is the same.

## In-game world scale doesn't match the L3DT terrain

**Q**: My terrain isn't sized correctly in-game!

**A**: Make sure your `WorldSizeX`/`WorldSizeZ` matches the size in L3DT. Also check if you calculated the `WorldSizeY` value correctly.

## Terrain texture is solid black

**Q**: My terrain's textures appear as solid black in-game!

**A**: Your texture names in your page file don't match the filename. 

## Terrain texture is shiny 

**Q**: My terrain's texture is very shiny in-game!

**A**: You didn't apply the alpha mask in GIMP correctly.

## RoR crashes while loading the terrain

**Q**: My game crashes when I try to load my terrain!

**A**: Check all your files and make sure you didn't make any syntax errors. You can also check your `RoR.log` to see where the crash occurs at.

## More help

**Q**: My issue isn't listed, please help!
