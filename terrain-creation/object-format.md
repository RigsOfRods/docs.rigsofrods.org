# Introduction

The `.odef` format specifies a static object that can be placed on a terrain. 
These files are placed in the same zip as the object's mesh files. Rigs of Rods will not load the object if the file does not exist!     


Basic example with a collision mesh:   
<br>
```
Building.mesh
1, 1, 1

beginmesh
mesh BuildingCollision.mesh
endmesh

end
```

Advanced example file featuring event boxes:

```
hangar.mesh
1, 1, 1

beginmesh
mesh hangar.mesh
endmesh


beginbox
boxcoords -23.75, -21.75, -0.2, 2.1, -3.07, -0.19
virtual
event shopplane avatar
endbox

beginbox
boxcoords  -17, 17, 0, 4.5, -29, 4
virtual
event spawnzone
direction 0, 90, 0
endbox

end
``` 

The format is described below: 

The first line specifies the visual mesh to use 

The second line specifies the scale of it (`x`, `y`, `z`) 
Default: `1,1,1`

After that, several sections can follow (`beginbox`, `beginmesh`, `playanimation`) 

The `.odef` file must be always closed with `end`

If there are no Begin box nor Begin mesh sections, the object will be throughable. 

# Commands 

These commands can be called outside or inside a `beginbox` or `beginmesh`:

## setMeshMaterial

`setMeshMaterial tracks/bigsign/town` 

 You can create different materials (red, blue, green skins) for your object and now, you only need to create 3 different `.odef` files, one for each color. 

For example you create a file called `myRedBuilding.odef` and inside you specify `setMeshMaterial myRedColor`, `myRedColor` is defined on any `.material` file you need to create.

## nocast

Disables shadow casting for the object. Useful for skyboxes.

Example:

```
Building.mesh
1, 1, 1

beginmesh
mesh BuildingCollision.mesh
endmesh

nocast

end
```



# Begin box 

Specifies a box that can be used for collisions or events.

`boxcoords x, x1, y, y1, z, z1` where the upper near left vertex of the 3D box is (`x`, `y`, `z`) and the lower far right vertex of the box is (`x1`, `y1`, `z1`). If you are defining a collision box, you don't need any other optional commands, just `endbox`. 

**optional:** `virtual`: this makes the box to spawn an event. In this case you must also have an event line in this box: 

**optional:** `event eventname filterevent` 

`eventname`: the name of the event it should generate. 

Some predefined values are `shopboat`, `shoptruck`, `shopplane`, `shoptrain` and `spawnzone` but you can define a non existing eventname if you want to use with Angelscript.

`filterevent`: on what it should trigger. valid values: `avatar`, `truck`, and `airplane`. 

**optional:**`direction 0, 90, 0`: this determines the direction of objects spawned in this box 

**optional:**`camera x, y, z`: Coordinates to place the camera. 

**optional:**`forcecamera x, y, z`: Coordinates to place the camera, and force to change to this camera point of view when player enter at the box coords. 

**optional:**`frictionconfig name-groundmodel.cfg` 

Loads a custom groundmodel config. Use this if you want to use a groundmodel not specified in `ground_models.cfg`. 

`name-groundmodel.cfg` is the name of your groundmodel config file. 

**optional:**`stdfriction name` 

Where `name` is either `concrete`, `asphalt`,`gravel`, `rock`, `ice`, `snow`, `metal`, `grass` or `sand`: this will set the type of friction the collision box will do. The physical parameters of these standard friction materials are defined in the configuration file `ground_models.cfg`.

**optional:**`friction adhesion velocity, static friction coef, dynamic friction coef, hydrodynamic coef, Stribeck velocity, alpha, strength, fx_type, [fx_color]`: this will set the parameters of the friction the collision box will do. The physical parameters are manually given.



`endbox` must close the box

```
beginbox
boxcoords -23.75, -21.75, -0.2, 2.1, -3.07, -0.19
virtual
event shopplane avatar
endbox
``` 

Whenever the character (RoRbot) enters the box specifies by boxcoords, a trigger `shopplane` will be triggered, so the spawn menu will be shown.

# Begin mesh

You can use a existing mesh that RoR collision system will use. 

`beginmesh`: this enables you to use meshes for collisions: 

`mesh hangar.mesh`: this load the mesh hangar.mesh as a collision mesh. Important: Only use very low polygon meshes, or the simulation will be slowed down drastically! 

`endmesh`: closes the actual mesh box

You can also use the option `stdfriction` with this syntax. 

For example, if you have made a road object in 3D and you want to give it an asphalt friction, give it an odef file like this one:

```
mr_road.mesh
1, 1, 1

beginmesh
mesh mr_road.mesh
stdfriction asphalt
endmesh

end
```

# Animations

If your object has an animation you can play it with this additional line: 

`playanimation speedfactorMin speedfactorMax AnimationName`

Example from the terrain [Fall Run](http://forum.rigsofrods.org/resources/fall-run.149/):

`playanimation 0.5, 0.6, CAT_330c_diging`

Notes: These objects wont be collide-able, and the animation will loop forever 

# Particles

You can add chimneys or other particle effects to your object using this:

```
;particleSystem scale, x, y, z, particleInstanceName particleScriptName
particleSystem 1, 1, 1, 1, myfire1 enhancedFire
```
