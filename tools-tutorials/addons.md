# What are addons?

In the [Repository](https://forum.rigsofrods.org/resources/) and [Archives](http://archives.rigsofrods.net/), you will find a category for [addon parts](https://forum.rigsofrods.org/resources/categories/addons.15/). These are ready-to-install modifications for existing vehicles.

Some are designed for specific vehicles (e.g. bumpers/exhausts) while others can fit on any vehicle (e.g. wheels/tires). This page serves as a general guide on the basics of installing various types of parts. 

The only requirement is a plain text editor, such as Notepad. ([Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) is preferred)

**As always, read thoroughly and do not skip any steps. Most questions we get are simply caused by people not reading.**

# ReadMe files 

Inside most addon zips, you'll find a ReadMe text file. These contain info you need to know in order to install the part correctly, such as `managedmaterials` lines. 

However, not all ReadMe files are the same. Some will provide a detailed step-by-step tutorial, while others may just give the bare minimum `managedmaterials` lines, or may not include a ReadMe at all. 

# Vehicle body parts

Most parts on the Repository are designed to fit specific vehicles. This includes but not limited to bumpers, exhausts, extra lights, etc. 

In this example we will be installing the [Heavy Bumper for the Chevy K3500](https://forum.rigsofrods.org/resources/heavy-bumper-for-the-chevy-k3500.461/).

## Setting up

To begin, download & extract the part zip (in our case, `CHeavyBumper.zip`) into a new folder. The folder should contain the mesh, dds textures, PDN paintkit, and a readme text file:

![1](/images/addon-bumper-folder.png)

Next, browse to `Documents\Rigs of Rods 0.4\mods` and open `ChevyK3500.zip`:

![2](/images/addon-bumper-zip.png)

Find the `.truck` file you want to edit. For this example I'll be editing the `Standard cab Single rear wheels (lift)` version (`1990K3500_STD_LIFT.truck`)

Once you've figured out which truck you want the bumper on, drag the `.truck` file from the zip and into the folder containing the part you downloaded earlier:

![3](/images/addon-bumper-truckfolder.png)

## The truck file 

You will need to open two files, the truck file (`1990K3500_STD_LIFT.truck`) and the readme file (`ReadMe.txt`). The readme file contains the lines you need to copy into the truck file.

## Managedmaterials 

Before we begin, some notes:

- Some parts may include a `.material` file inside the zip. If this is the case then you don't need to specify anything in `managedmaterials`, just move the `.material` file into the vehicle's zip along with the other files.

- If you are unable to find the material name (ReadMe doesn't specify it), download [OgreMeshy](https://forum.rigsofrods.org/resources/ogremeshy.595/) and open the `.mesh`  file. You should see a similar line in red:

`Can't assign material 'ICD_AEZ_Forged' to SubEntity of 'MeshEntity' because this Material does not exist in group 'InternalMeshGroup'. Have you forgotten to define it in a .material script?`

In the above example, `ICD_AEZ_Forged` would be the material name you set in `managedmaterials`.

With that said, in the truck file, scroll down until you find the `managedmaterials` section. It will look like this:

```
managedmaterials
set_managedmaterials_options 1
BK3500			mesh_standard		K3500-Tex.png		K3500_S.png
K3500_Frame		mesh_standard		Chassis_Bake.png		Chassis_Bake_S.png

BFGA			mesh_standard		BFGA.png		Black.png
DWindow			mesh_standard		Dwindow.png		Dwindow_S.png
```

For this bumper, you have the choice between clean or rusted, as shown in the readme: 

```
Black
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHeavyBumper		mesh_standard		HeavyBumper.dds		HeavyBumper_s.dds

Rusted
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHeavyBumper		mesh_standard		HeavyBumper_Rusted.dds		HeavyBumper_Rusted_s.dds
```

We will choose the clean version. Paste the line at the bottom of the `managedmaterials` section. Example:

```
managedmaterials
set_managedmaterials_options 1
BK3500			mesh_standard		K3500-Tex.png		K3500_S.png

```

## Flexbodies/props

Before we begin, a few notes:

- If the placement line does not have a `forset` line, this means it is placed under the `props` section. Just search `props` instead. 

- If the readme doesn't contain a placement line, it usually means the part uses the same placement as the vehicle's other parts. 
In this case you would just copy one of the other placements and change the mesh name to the part. The readme will most likely specify this. 

- Some parts (such as truck beds) may require you to edit the vehicle model (e.g. Bed is part of cab model) in order to install the part. 
To do this, see: [Blender mesh editing](/tools-tutorials/blender-mesh-editing/)

With that out of the way, search (`CTRL+F`) for `flexbodies`. You will see this:

```
flexbodies
39, 62, 34,    0.50,    0.32,     -0.5,   0,    180,    180, K3500_FBump.mesh
forset 175-178, 76-79, 28-31

39, 62, 34,    0.50,    0.32,     -0.5,   0,    180,    180, K3500_Badge.mesh
forset 149-160
```

Since the vehicle obviously already has a bumper, you will have to remove or comment (`;`) the original bumper line. For example: 
 
 ```
;39, 62, 34,    0.50,    0.32,     -0.5,   0,    180,    180, K3500_FBump.mesh
;forset 175-178, 76-79, 28-31
```

Now copy the placement line from the readme and paste it below the original bumper line, like so:

```
flexbodies
;39, 62, 34,    0.50,    0.32,     -0.5,   0,    180,    180, K3500_FBump.mesh
;forset 175-178, 76-79, 28-31

39, 62, 34,    0.50,    0.32,     -0.5,   0,    180,    180, CHeavyBumper.mesh
forset 175-178, 76-79, 28-31

39, 62, 34,    0.50,    0.32,     -0.5,   0,    180,    180, K3500_Badge.mesh
forset 149-160
```

For more info on props and flexbodies, see: [Props](/vehicle-creation/fileformat-truck/#props)

You can now save & close the truck file. 

## Packaging

All that's left to do is to move the truck file, textures, and mesh back into the vehicle zip. 

If the part includes multiple textures, you can only copy the files required by the `managedmaterials` section, in this case `HeavyBumper.dds` and `HeavyBumper_s.dds`.

## In-game

Now it's time to test your newly installed part in-game. If you followed this tutorial exactly, you should now have a custom bumper on your K3500! 

![4](/images/addon-bumper-ingame.png)

# Wheels and tires 

Keeping with the K3500, in this example we will be installing the [5 Spoke Wheel](https://forum.rigsofrods.org/resources/5-spoke-wheel.464/).

## Setting up

To begin, download & extract the part zip (in our case, `5SpokeRim.zip`) into a new folder. The folder should contain the mesh, dds textures, PDN paintkit, and a readme text file:

![1](/images/addon-wheel-folder.png)

Next, browse to `Documents\Rigs of Rods 0.4\mods` and open `ChevyK3500.zip`:

![2](/images/addon-bumper-zip.png)

Find the `.truck` file you want to edit. For this example I'll be editing the `Standard cab Single rear wheels (lift)` version (`1990K3500_STD_LIFT.truck`)

Once you've figured out which truck you want the bumper on, drag the `.truck` file from the zip and into the folder containing the part you downloaded earlier:

![3](/images/addon-wheel-truckfolder.png)

## The truck file 

You will need to open two files, the truck file (`1990K3500_STD_LIFT.truck`) and the readme file (`ReadMe.txt`). The readme file contains the lines you need to copy into the truck file.

## Managedmaterials 

Before we begin, some notes:

- Some parts may include a `.material` file inside the zip. If this is the case then you don't need to specify anything in `managedmaterials`, just move the `.material` file into the vehicle's zip along with the other files.

- If you are unable to find the material name (ReadMe doesn't specify it), download [OgreMeshy](https://forum.rigsofrods.org/resources/ogremeshy.595/) and open the `.mesh`  file. You should see a similar line in red:

`Can't assign material 'ICD_AEZ_Forged' to SubEntity of 'MeshEntity' because this Material does not exist in group 'InternalMeshGroup'. Have you forgotten to define it in a .material script?`

In the above example, `ICD_AEZ_Forged` would be the material name you set in `managedmaterials`.

With that said, in the truck file, scroll down until you find the `managedmaterials` section. It will look like this:

```

```

The readme for this wheel contains the following `managedmaterials` lines:

```

MudTerrains 		mesh_standard		MudTerrain.dds		MudTerrain_s.dds

## Meshwheels 

Before we continue, a few notes:

- Some wheels may include a tire with the wheel mesh, in this case you'll have to set the tire material to `tracks/trans`. The examples below already have it set. 

- Some wheels may have the tire as a separate mesh, in this case see: [Flexbody wheels](vehicle-creation/flexbody-wheels/)

- If the wheel is inside out ingame, swap the `l` and `r` values before the mesh name. The second example below had to be swapped.

With that said, scroll down until you find the `meshwheels` section. You will see the following:

```
meshwheels
;tire_radius, rim_radius, width, numrays, node1, node2, snode, braked, propulsed, arm,  mass,   spring, damping, side,               meshname         material
0.43,       0.2785,   0.5,      12,    84,    86,    9999,      1,         1,   6, 160.0, 190000.0,  1200.0,    r,   ToyoOC_Wheel.mesh tracks/trans
0.43,       0.2785,   0.5,      12,    85,    87,    9999,      1,         1,   6, 160.0, 190000.0,  1200.0,    l,   ToyoOC_Wheel.mesh tracks/trans
0.43,       0.2785,   0.5,      12,    95,    96,     9999,      1,         1,  6, 160.0, 190000.0,  1200.0,    r,   ToyoOC_Wheel.mesh tracks/trans
0.43,       0.2785,   0.5,      12,    103,   105,    9999,      1,         1,  6, 160.0, 190000.0,  1200.0,    l,   ToyoOC_Wheel.mesh tracks/trans
```

Replace `ToyoOC_Wheel.mesh` with your wheel mesh, in this case `5SpokeRim.mesh`:

```
meshwheels
;tire_radius, rim_radius, width, numrays, node1, node2, snode, braked, propulsed, arm,  mass,   spring, damping, side,               meshname         material
0.43,       0.2785,   0.5,      12,    84,    86,    9999,      1,         1,   6, 160.0, 190000.0,  1200.0,    l,   5SpokeRim.mesh tracks/trans
0.43,       0.2785,   0.5,      12,    85,    87,    9999,      1,         1,   6, 160.0, 190000.0,  1200.0,    r,   5SpokeRim.mesh tracks/trans
0.43,       0.2785,   0.5,      12,    95,    96,     9999,      1,         1,  6, 160.0, 190000.0,  1200.0,    l,   5SpokeRim.mesh tracks/trans
0.43,       0.2785,   0.5,      12,    103,   105,    9999,      1,         1,  6, 160.0, 190000.0,  1200.0,    r,   5SpokeRim.mesh tracks/trans
```

For more info on meshwheels, see: [Meshwheels](/vehicle-creation/fileformat-truck/#meshwheels)

You can now save & close the truck file. 

## Packaging

All that's left to do is to move the truck file, textures, and mesh back into the vehicle zip. 

If the part includes multiple textures, you can only copy the files required by the `managedmaterials` section.

## In-game

Now it's time to test your newly installed wheel in-game. If you followed this tutorial exactly, you should now have new wheels on your K3500! 

![4](/images/addon-wheel-ingame.png)

# Troubleshooting

## Part doesn't appear ingame 

If the part doesn't appear ingame, make sure you saved and copied the correct files into the zip and did all `.truck` file edits correctly.

Some parts may require you to adjust the prop/flexbody placement. Press `E` twice to make sure it's not under the map. 

## White/pink textures 

If the part appears as white or pink ingame, you set the wrong `managedmaterials` lines or didn't copy the `.material` file. 

If you need help finding the material name, see the second note in [Managedmaterials](#managedmaterials)

# Conclusion

You should now know the basics of installing addon parts in Rigs of Rods. I hope this answers most questions people have. Please contact the staff if you'd like any more examples added.
