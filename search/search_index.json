On Windows this is located at <code>Documents\\My Games\\Rigs of Rods</code> or at <code>~/.rigsofrods</code> on Linux. This is where configuration files, logs, and mods are stored.   </p> <p>The game should open in a small window:</p> <p></p> <p>Before playing, you should first change your settings. Begin by clicking <code>Settings</code>.</p> <p>First, make sure the rendering system is set to <code>Direct3D9 Rendering Subsystem</code>. If it's set to <code>OpenGL Rendering Subsystem</code>, change it then restart RoR. If Direct3D9 doesn't appear on the list, install the DirectX Runtime and restart your PC.</p> <p>If you're running Linux, ignore this as DirectX is not available. </p> <p></p> <p>Now select <code>Video Mode</code> and change it to your monitor's native resolution then restart the game to apply your changes.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Click <code>Settings</code> again, then click the <code>Graphics</code> tab.</p> <p>The following settings should be fine for most people, but feel free to adjust them to fit your liking.</p> <p></p> <p>Then click the <code>Audio</code> tab and set the device and volume.</p> <p></p> <p>Once you're finished, restart the game again. </p> <p>Now you're ready to begin playing. Start by clicking <code>Single player</code> to open the terrain selector. </p> <p></p> <p>For the sake of this tutorial, select North St Helens. </p> <p>Note</p> <p>Depending on how you downloaded the game, the North St Helens terrain may be missing. If so, please install it from the Repository before continuing.</p> <p>Once the terrain loads, you will spawn as a country person known lovingly as RoRBot. You control him with the arrow keys while using <code>SHIFT</code> to run and <code>SPACE</code> to jump (good for getting over bumps, or if you get stuck).</p> <p></p> <p>You spawn in front of a building known as the Rig-a-Deal. This is where you will spawn new trucks. Walk into the \"Office\" to bring up the selection menu. You can also spawn a vehicle anywhere at any time by pressing <code>CTRL+G</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>Use the mouse or arrow keys to move through the menus. Select the DAF Semi truck. The truck spawns inside the Rig-a-Deal with you inside it. If you happen to spawn the truck with RoRBot outside of the vehicle, simply hit <code>ENTER</code>/<code>RETURN</code> to get in a vehicle.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"gameplay/beginners-guide/#driving","title":"Driving","text":"<p>The DAF semi isn't the most agile or best looking truck in the game, but it serves us a purpose later. The camera inside the Rig-a-Deal is fixed, so you will be unable to move it until you leave. Switch to the in-cab camera by hitting <code>C</code>. Use the <code>UP</code> arrow key to accelerate out of the Rig-a-Deal (Rigs of Rods uses a simulated clutch which begins to engages at a specific point. This why the semi doesn't move until 1000 RPM). Use <code>DOWN</code> to brake, and <code>LEFT</code>/<code>RIGHT</code> arrows to steer. Use <code>PGUP</code>/<code>PGDOWN</code> to select your transmission direction/speed.</p> <p>Start by exploring Coldwater, the town you begin in. It isn't very big but provides some decent moving room. If you get stuck, or wreck, hit <code>I</code> to reset back to the Rig-a-Deal, or <code>BACKSPACE</code> to reset the truck in its current position. </p> <p>If you hold <code>BACKSPACE</code> for one second, you will enable the \"advanced repair mode\" which lets you move the vehicle to any position by using the <code>WASD</code> keys to move and the arrow keys to rotate. Press <code>BACKSPACE</code> again to exit.</p> <p>You can switch transmission modes by hitting <code>Q</code>. There are 5 transmission modes available:  * Automatic shift   * The gear change is fully automatic, the player only has to set the gear by pressing <code>PGUP</code>/<code>PGDOWN</code>. * Manual shift: Auto clutch   * The gear is changed on user request. No clutch should be pressed to change gear, vehicle takes care of that. Just use <code>A</code> and <code>Z</code> to shift.  * Fully manual: sequential shift   * The user must press clutch and select whether it is needed to switch up or down. Depress the clutch by hitting <code>LEFT SHIFT</code>, then press <code>A</code> to upshift or <code>Z</code> to downshift.  * Fully manual: stick shift   * This mode is useful if you have a game controller with an H-shifter (like Logitech G27). In this mode the player can set gears 1-6, N, and R directly by the stick.  * Fully manual: stick shift with ranges   * This mode is mostly used in vehicles having more gears than 6. In this case you can select from 3 ranges: low (gear 1-6), medium (gear 7-12), high (gear 13-18) by pressing the appropriate button. Like if you want to select the 8<sup>th</sup> gear, you have to select gear N first, press the midrange button, then select the 2<sup>nd</sup> gear on the h-stick. Remember, range selection can be made only if the gear is in N.</p> <p>If you stall, there are 2 keys to be remembered: <code>X</code> enables or disables the electricity in the vehicle, and <code>S</code> activates the starter. Press <code>X</code> and you'll see a yellow battery icon lit on the UI. Hold <code>S</code> until the engine is started. Resetting the vehicle with <code>BACKSPACE</code> or <code>I</code> will instantly start the engine.</p> <p>Remember how to change the camera? Hit <code>C</code> twice. You're now in third-person view and can move the camera around. Use the number pad (specifically <code>2</code>, <code>4</code>, <code>6</code>, and <code>8</code>) to move the camera. Pressing <code>5</code> resets the camera. <code>9</code> and <code>3</code> zoom in/out respectively and <code>1</code> gives you a front view of your truck.</p> <p>You can also move the camera by holding right-click and dragging with your mouse.</p> <p>Now, make your way back to the Rig-a-Deal.</p>"},{"location":"gameplay/beginners-guide/#trailer-loads","title":"Trailer Loads","text":"<p>You should see a large, grey, open-platform with an orange console.

Use the camera in third-person view to help you if you need. Back into the trailer. When you get close, use <code>F1</code>/<code>F2</code> to lower and raise the trailer legs respectively. </p> <p>The hook points must be within 10cm to hook, so it may take some practice to get close. When you think you're close, hit <code>L</code>. If you're close enough, the semi will latch to the trailer. Raise the legs by holding <code>F1</code>. </p> <p></p> <p>You can now drive around with the trailer. You will notice that the trailer has a large effect on how the semi pulls and handles! This process is the same for most trailers. In some cases you can secure loads to trucks using <code>O</code>. </p> <p>NOTE: on some computers trailers may increase lag or decrease FPS(frames per second) dramatically!</p>"},{"location":"gameplay/beginners-guide/#flying","title":"Flying","text":"<p>Now that we've become comfortable with driving.

Turn on the flying lights by pressing <code>M</code>. Start the engines by using your mouse to click the <code>ON</code> buttons in the lower right hand corner (or by pressing <code>CTRL+HOME</code>). </p> <p>When the engines settle to the appropriate idle speed (somewhere near 750rpm), release the parking brake and throttle the engines to full by holding <code>PGUP</code>. Pressing <code>CTRL+PGUP</code> will instantly set the throttle to max. </p> <p>If you have a short runway, be sure to use the flaps with <code>1</code> and <code>2</code> (this is especially helpful in multiplayer). When you reach 75-80 knots, lift up by pressing the <code>DOWN</code> arrow. Steer with the <code>LEFT</code>/<code>RIGHT</code> arrows and control the rudder with <code>Z</code> and <code>X</code>. Raise the landing gear, in this plane, by holding <code>F3</code>. </p> <p>The An-12 does not stand high speeds (175+ knots) well, and you may find that if you go too fast the wings will break apart!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>When it comes to landing, make sure you have room to slow down and take your time. Going straight into the runway is the easiest way to land when you first start off. It may take a few passes to go head-on so don't be afraid to abort a landing and throttle back up to regain altitude. The entire process is easier if you shadows enabled, but is possible without. When you land, hit <code>R</code> to reverse thrust and throttle up to slow down in addition to using <code>B</code> to brake the wheels.</p> <p>This tutorial does not make use of the autopilot.

Values between 1 and 3.5 are great for vehicles that you drive frequently, or race vehicles and the like that you want to start fast. However, using a higher value makes it harder to stall the engine. Making something to tow a lot of weight? Raise it up to 9 or 10 and it won't really stall, ever.

Excuse the crap drawings; hopefully this will still be helpful. </p>"},{"location":"vehicle-creation/flexbody-deforming-detaching-parts/#instructions","title":"Instructions","text":"<p>First start by making a grid of nodes however many segments long and wide you need it to be (recommend at least 4 nodes wide and 4 nodes long for a hood) and fitting the shape of your body panel (this is for a hood or trunk; I'll talk about bumpers in a bit). Connect all of them together lengthwise/widthwise only. Give them a set_beam_defaults such that they can't deform or break at all (make the deform and break thresholds very high). These define the basic shape of the body part so they can't deform or break or you'll get weird glitchy stuff going on. </p> <p> </p> <p>Then make the 'crossing' beams. These are the beams that form an X inside each square and keep the shape together. These should have a set_beam_defaults making them unbreakable and hard to deform (deform value in the hundreds of thousands range for light cars) </p> <p> </p> <p>Now make the deformer beams. These hold the shape together rigidly and also keep it in a deformed shape when it bends. Do them like this, lengthwise and widthwise, between every other node and also between the back and front nodes. Set them to be unbreakable but with a pretty low deformation threshold. It'd be a good idea to put the lengthwise and widthwise deformers under separate set_beam_defaults values, so you can tweak individually the strength in both directions. </p> <p> </p> <p>Now if your body panel is pretty flat, like this, it's going to flop all over the place unless you support it from underneath. The best way to fight this is with stabilization nodes. Usually two nodes floating about 0.3 meters above or below are a good way to do it. Connect both of those nodes to every single node of your body panel and each other, and make those beams unbreakable but easy to deform. I haven't drawn about half of them because the image would get too cluttered. You can also get away with having just one stabilization node. </p> <p> </p> <p>Next is the hinge. Attach all of the nodes of the back two rows (closest to the hinge) to two nodes you can hinge from on your main body. Set these beams to be fairly stiff but also breakable (deform &amp; break values in the hundred thousand range for light cars). </p> <p> </p> <p>Now you need to support the hood/trunk from underneath so it doesn't fall inwards. Make beams going downwards from each hood node to the bottom of your frame/body, and give them the \"s\" flag so they resist compression but not extension. This allows the hood/trunk/whatever to push upwards/pop open but doesn't let it fall inwards into the body. Make sure the set_beam_defaults damping is set to 1 or 0 for the support beams, so when a part detaches it doesn't get dragged along with the car for a ways until the support beams break. These should be pretty easy to deform (around 50000) but harder to break (they break automatically when they reach 4x their length, so if your hood or whatever falls off, you don't need to worry about making these easy to break). </p> <p> </p> <p>Finally, the latch. This will keep the hood (or whatever it is you're doing) completely locked in place to the body until the latch breaks, at which point it'll pop open and swing on its hinges. Make downwards beams attaching the frontmost nodes of the panel to the closest frame/body nodes. These should be easy to deform and have a break threshold only slightly above the deform. These might not be rigid unless you also attach them to a second segment of nodes (either the next one on the hood or a segment below on the body). </p> <p> </p> <p>Bumpers are a similar deal, but the 'hinges' should be at both corners, and the node/beam should obviously be shaped like a bumper. Bumpers should also be less susceptible to deformation, since they're usually made of plastic or spring steel. </p> <p>This also works for doors (replace latch with commands if you want them to be openable) </p> <p>One final note: if your body panel shape is quite curved and convex/concave, you probably won't need the stabilization nodes/beams. My '49 Ford hood has no stabilization nodes because the shape is curved enough to be rigid on its own. </p>"},{"location":"vehicle-creation/flexbody-deforming-detaching-parts/#credits","title":"Credits","text":"<p>This was originally written by Gabester.</p>"},{"location":"vehicle-creation/flexbody-wheels/","title":"Flexbody wheels","text":"Number of wheels  Wheel rays  Chassis nodes  Cameras before wheel section"},{"location":"vehicle-creation/flexbody-wheels/#what-is-this","title":"What is this?","text":"<p>By default, Rigs of Rods's meshwheels sections generate a tire using a texture.

Other vehicle simulators use fake suspension, mesh-based vehicles with no mass distribution, predetermined damage from collisions, and approximated fuzzy-dice sway models. </p> <p>RoR uses a very unique way to simulate a truck. In fact, it does not simulates a truck at all... It only simulates a set of points, called Nodes interconnected by Beams. Assembling these elements to form the structure of a truck makes a truck. But you could also assemble them to do a car, a bike, a giant robot, a boat, a plane, a building, a bridge, anything, and it would be simulated the same way. </p> <p>To grasp the idea, take a look at these games that use the same construction logic:</p> <ul> <li>Geomag is a real-world construction game that uses metallic balls and magnets.</li> <li>Bridge Construction Set is a video game where you build and test bridges.</li> </ul> <p>To build a truck in RoR, you need to design a structural chassis composed of a lattice of rods. You have to define :</p> <ul> <li>Nodes: these are the points of interconnection of rods (the same as the balls in Geomag). For the physics engine, these nodes are the only concrete elements of the truck: they have a mass and can collide with other elements, but they are dimensionless.</li> <li>Beams: (or rods): they interconnect nodes. For the physics engine they are massless and are composed of a spring and a damper, so their length can change depending on the forces it bears. They are monodimensional - they have length, but no thickness.</li> </ul> <p>Also, if you want to \"dress\" the chassis with a texture, you can \"fill\" any node triangle with a polygon (like the panels in geomag, but in RoR they deform like if they were made of rubber). This is what the submesh section if for.</p> <p>One important thing is that the interconnection of beams to nodes uses what is known as a ball joint. That means that no force opposes a change of angles between two beams connected to the same node. It may sound abstract, but in practice you will immediately see the result : anything that is not triangulated will fold. To design rigid bodies you must have triangles everywhere, in any direction. So for example, if you have a cubic structure, you must add diagonal rods in all the faces. If you let a square somewhere it will fold, or it will be a soft zone (it will stay rigid because of other parts of the geometry, adding strains to this part).</p> <p></p> <p>Why did we chose ball joints? Because:</p> <ul> <li>It requires less computation to simulate, and keep the physics simple (because of this, the simulated elements are dimensionless, that means that a lot of physics law are irrelevant and do not need to be simulated. The good news is that the laws we ignored (as rotation momentum, center of gravity, centripetal force...), are here anyway, as you can observe, because they emerge from the complex interaction between beams)</li> <li>It can be used to build almost any kind of joint. By assembling rods in certain way, you can constraint movements and synthesize most useful joints. For example the suspensions and direction of trucks uses such construction techniques to limit movements only in certain directions.</li> </ul> <p>A note on beam strength: A beam's length changes depending on the forces (compressive or extensive) it bears. When the forces are gone, it returns to its original length (elastic deformation). If the forces are too strong, it will not return to its original length (plastic deformation). If the forces are even stronger, it will snap and disappear!</p>"},{"location":"vehicle-creation/weight-tuning/","title":"Weight tuning","text":""},{"location":"vehicle-creation/weight-tuning/#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>SUMOWEIGHT ? </p> <p>A guide to tune your trucks to a realistic weight</p> <p>I will try to explain here how to tune your trucks weight without loosing it characteristics.

That purpose is to determine where the torque reaction in a chassis will be. If that node is placed in front of the specified wheel, then it will provide more traction, as the wheel pushes the chassis down into the ground. This is good for vehicles such as off-roaders and high-grip racecars. If the arm node is behind the specified wheel, then grip will be reduced as the wheel will help lift the chassis off the ground. This is useful for drifters and other cars and trucks that need less grip.</p>"},{"location":"vehicle-creation/wheels-axles-steering/#how-it-is-implemented","title":"How it is Implemented","text":"<p>The arm node is implemented through the wheels section of a <code>.truck</code> file.</p>"},{"location":"vehicle-creation/wheels-axles-steering/#example-vehicle","title":"Example Vehicle","text":"<p>A good example vehicle that shows how the arm node works is box5diesel's Baja Trophy Truck. When in the air, if you accelerate in 6<sup>th</sup> gear, the nose of the truck will be lifted up. If you brake while in the air, the nose of the truck will be pushed down.
